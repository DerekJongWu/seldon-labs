Thank you very much for being here. We have largely an energy group today.We're looking to be very energy dominant, and we will be in a very short order. These are great professionals.But before we do that, we'll be signing an Executive order having to do with COVID and schools.Lindsey.White House Senior Associate Staff Secretary Lindsey Halligan. Yes. So, this first Executive order, it prohibits Federal funding for COVID\u201319 mandates\u2014vaccine mandates in schools.The President. Okay, and that will\u2014meaning they want to clear that up\u2014\u2014Associate Staff Secretary Halligan. Yes.The President. \u2014\u2014the discrepancy.Associate Staff Secretary Halligan. So any schools that require students to be vaccinated with the COVID\u201319 shot, then there's no more Federal funding. So\u2014\u2014The President. Okay.[At this point, the President signed an Executive order titled, \"Keeping Education Accessible and Ending COVID\u201319 Vaccine Mandates in Schools.\"]Okay. That solves that problem.COVID\u201319 Vaccine Mandates in SchoolsQ. Sir, will the Department of Education have to handle that request?The President. Yes, it is up to the Department of Education. Okay. Thanks.Associate Staff Secretary Halligan. Okay. And then\u2014\u2014Secretary of Transportation Sean P. Duffy. Can I make one comment, Mr. President?The President. Yes, please.Secretary Duffy. As a father of nine, I thank you. We should have parental freedom to decide what vaccines our kids take, as opposed to school systems and Governors forcing upon the people that love these kids the most, which is the parents. So thank you for signing that.The President. Great. Thank you very much. People wanted that very badly. Okay.Associate Staff Secretary Halligan. Okay. And here is an Executive order establishing the National Energy Dominance Council. So that will be chaired by the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Burgum, and the Vice Chair, Chris Wright.And so this will reduce costs with respect to energy, establish American independence with energy, and also unleash energy dominance.The President. Good. Thank you. And this is a big deal. We have more energy than any other country, and now we're unleashing it, to put it nicely.And I'd like to ask Doug\u2014you're going to be heading it up, you and Chris\u2014would you say a few words about it, please?Secretary of the Interior Douglas J. Burgum. Yes, absolutely, sir. Good afternoon. President Trump wisely understood that, under the Biden administration, there was a war against American energy, and today that war officially has ended.President Trump, on day one, declared a national energy emergency, and this is a real emergency, because under the Biden administration, restricted the production of oil and gas. Production is still coming, but when you stop holding leases, when you take 625 million acres of land out of\u2014ocean land out of production possibilities through an Executive order, you're really restricting the balance sheet of America.But today, as President Trump said, this is unleashed. The National Energy Dominance Council will be made up\u2014all the folks that are standing beside me here, other Cabinet leaders, and many more represent President Trump's wise decision that we need a whole-of-Government approach to unwind.The Biden administration had a whole-of-Government approach that had the war againstU.S. energy. Now we need to turn that around 180 degrees and unleash that potential.We've got to unleash it from the Gulf of America all the way up to Alaska. We have amazing resources in this country, and we haven't been getting a return on them. Many of these are under public lands. The interior has 500 million acres of surface; 700 million acres of subsurface minerals, critical minerals; and offshore, close to 2 billion acres.And that balance sheet makes the\u2014is the biggest balance sheet in the world, and it's been completely underutilized.Everybody knows we have $36 trillion in debt as a country, but no one knows how many hundreds of trillions of dollars of assets we have. And President Trump is asking us to go get a return on that investment for the American people.And, with that, we're going to have prosperity at home with lower prices, and we're also going to have peace abroad, because the wars that we've been engaged in or our allies have been fighting over the past few years have been funded by the oil sales of our adversaries.So we have an opportunity, and we\u2014also, we're in an AI arms race with China. The only way we win that is with more electricity. And we also have an energy emergency in terms of electricity\u2014too much intermittent, unreliable; not enough baseload. We've been shutting down the baseload that we have. President Trump is going to reverse that, and it's going to allow us to win the AI arms race, which is the most important thing that we have to do relative to our future.So, with that, I want to say, again, thank you to President Trump.The President. Yes.Secretary Burgum. And I want to thank my fellow members of the Energy Council here. I'm going to kick it over to the vice chair, Chris Wright, the\u2014who's the Secretary of the Department of Energy.Secretary of Energy Christopher A. Wright. Thank you, Secretary Burgum. Today is truly a great day for our country today. And Secretary Burgum laid out so many of the problems the last4 years. If you put barriers in front of energy, you make it more expensive, you make it less reliable, make it harder to do business here, and harder for our consumers to pay their bills.With this fantastic action from our President, we now have authority across the Government to lean in to fix these problems. And I'll start out with one specific right away.This morning I signed our first LNG export license, unpausing the pause in inaction. The Commonwealth LNG project that will be on the Gulf Coast in Louisiana is now officially ready to go.This will be a large construction project for American workers. It will draw demand for more American energy production that will be shipped overseas to our allies. Many more of those to come.We're also working aggressively to roll back standards that have made appliances more expensive for Americans. And dishwashers that take 2 hours long and don't get your dishes clean\u2014[laughter]\u2014nobody likes that. That's about standing in the way. And with this President\u2014President Trump\u2014and our new National Energy Dominance Council, there's so many things we can do to make American lives better, bring down costs, and grow opportunities.And with that, I'm going to kick it over to a fellow member of the Council, our Administrator of the EPA, Lee Zeldin.Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee M. Zeldin. Thank you, Secretary. And honored to be serving on the Energy Dominance Council. At EPA, we're doing our part to power the great American comeback. And President Trump has made it clear that he wants EPA to be doing our job to ensure that we are unleashing energy dominance however we can help, that we are assisting in making America the AI capital of the world, that we are pursuing permitting reform, that we are helping to bring back American auto jobs.This is the mandate of the American public, that the Trump mandate was clear, and the guidance from President Trump to me when he asked me, thankfully, for the opportunity for us to be able to serve together in partnership to unleash energy dominance. This is a moment that we must meet.To that end, it is important to note that the prior Biden-Harris EPA issued a waiver to California for tailpipe emissions. This was a rule that should have been submitted to Congress. We will submit it to Congress. Congress will have the opportunity, through the Congressional Review Act, to make that waiver go away. We will do everything in our part to help the American people to make life in America more affordable.The golden age of American success is upon us. If you're excited about the last 3 weeks, that was just a taste of the main event, the entr\u00e9e to come\u2014the next 4 years being the greatest term in the history of the American Presidency.With that, I'd like to introduce Sean Duffy.Secretary Duffy. Thank you. So, first of all, thank you for the work on dishwashers. We use more water to wash our dishes before we put them in the dishwasher.The President. That's right.Secretary Duffy. We're not saving water; we're using more water. So thank you for that.But I'm also joining the EPA. We've introduced our rules to start to look at the CAFE standards. So we're looking at how much it costs for end users when they put gas in their car. And the Biden-era standards are costing billions of dollars in taxes and carbon credits, which drive up the costs of vehicles.And so we're going to remedy that, rectify it, and make sure we're bringing down the cost of a car, number one.Number two, if I could just mention, Mr. President, per your direction, we are going to move forward with a permitting process for the Texas GulfLink deep water port, making sure we can move energy in and out of the country. So that's\u2014that was held up for 5 years, and it was stonewalled, bureaucrats got in the way. We're now going to move forward with that, making sure we have great oil infrastructure in the country.The President. That's great. Thanks. Great job.Secretary Duffy. Howard Lutnick.The President. Yes.Secretary of Commerce Howard W. Lutnick. So the nanny State. You're feeling the end of the nanny State, from straws made of paper to regulation endlessly harming Americans and holding us back. It slows down our production and manufacturing, which we were talking about with the Prime Minister of India yesterday, you're hearing that about energy dominance. It's going to go away.We're going to care about Americans. The Trump administration and this President cares about Americans. And you're going to feel a change. You're going to feel the price of energy coming down. You're going to feel prices coming down. You're going to feel an explosion. The golden age of manufacturing of America has always been there. It's just been stifled by regulation, and that time is over.The President. All right. Thank you very much, Howard. Please.National Economic Council Director Kevin A. Hassett. Mr. President, I just want to say that you've built such an incredible team and, Secretary and Chairman Burgum, that he's been working on this his whole life. And so what I expect you to see, sir, is action as early as next week that is going to shock people about how good it is for Americans. And so thank you for your leadership, sir.The President. Thank you very much, Kevin.And we are also working on a project that has been under wraps for 20 years. Everybody wanted it. It's been held up by New York. It's a pipeline that will bring down the energy prices in New York and in all of New England by 50, 60, 70 percent. It should have been done years ago. We'll be speaking to New York and the\u2014New York is actually the biggest beneficiary, because their energy costs are very high. This will reduce it very substantially.But the\u2014all of the Governors want this to happen, and I think it's going to happen. It's now going to happen. It's something that's\u2014would rather not have to go eminent domain. We'll do that if we have to in New York. But hopefully, we won't have to do that.This, again, will bring down energy prices in New England by numbers that nobody can even believe\u2014probably 50, 60 percent, maybe even more than that. A lot of them don't even pay energy because they have no energy. They use logs. They go out, and they cut down a tree. It's really a terrible situation.So we're going to get this done, and we can have it done\u2014once we start construction, we're looking at anywhere from 9 to 12 months, if you can believe it. It's going to go very rapidly.The other thing I'd like Doug to mention\u2014the 635 million acres that Biden so viciously took out of our\u2014our net worth. If you look at it from the standpoint of a company, you'd talk about net worth. They've destroyed our net worth. We're putting it back. It will be back as of this afternoon.And, Doug, could you mention that\u2014all of the millions and millions of acres that he just handed back to nobody?Secretary Burgum. Yes, the\u2014right\u2014the Executive order by President Biden that wiped out these trillions from our balance sheet, President Trump signed an Executive order instructing me, as the Secretary of Interior, to unban that ban, and that's been accomplished. And so, those are back on the U.S. balance sheet.The President. Okay.Offshore Energy ResourcesQ. I'm sorry, which one is that?Secretary Burgum. The 625 million acres of offshore that was banned from further lease sales.The President. Further anything. You couldn't even\u2014\u2014Secretary Burgum. 625 million acres\u2014\u2014The President. Right.Secretary Burgum. \u2014\u2014is one-third the size of the lower 48 that was taken off our balance sheet. It's back on there now. President Trump cares about the American people. He knows that these public lands belong to the public. They don't belong to Washington bureaucrats from the prior administration. And we're going to make sure that we get a return on investment for the American people.The President. The amount of money that he took off our balance sheet\u2014if you look at as a balance sheet\u2014it was incalculable. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. And he did that, I guess, in the last few days of the administration. He just wiped it out\u2014635 million acres\u2014which, if you sit down and look, it's like, that's a major part of the ocean. And he just gave it away and took it away. And fortunately, it wasn't done with an act of Congress or anything. And we did it in a, I think, very abbreviated, very quick, and very legal procedure. And it's now back on our balance sheet. It's back as part of our country.What they did was so horrible. It was just a terrible thing to do, an unbelievable thing to do.Also, they mentioned dishwashers and sinks and showers and the whole thing. We're going to get rid of those restrictions. You have many places where they have water\u2014they have so much water, they don't know what to do with it. But people buy a house, they turn on the sink and water barely comes out. They turn\u2014take a shower, water barely comes out, and it's an unnecessary restriction.And basically, I think we were going to be going back to the Trump rule. We had it and everybody was happy. And then these people came in and they restricted it again. So we're going back, and we'll get it approved by Congress. In addition, we'll get it approved by Congress. So, for 4 years, it's good, but we're going to get it permanently taken care of.And again, very environmental, very environmentally friendly, but we want to be able to\u2014 when somebody turns on a sink to wash their hands or presses the button for a dishwasher and there's barely enough water to\u2014I mean, there's no water. And you know what they do? They press the button 10 times. They run it 10 times, so it ends up costing a lot more.So I know you're working on that. And where are we on that?Administrator Zeldin. We're working closely with the Department of Energy with regards to rules\u2014\u2014The President. Right.Administrator Zeldin. \u2014\u2014that were enacted during the Biden administration. Inside of the EPA, we are overhauling the WaterSense standards that are there, to update them for the American people, to bring down cost of living and combat inflation and just pursue common sense.The President. Good. Well, we have more oil and gas than anybody else in the world. We're opening up ANWR again. As you know, we got something\u2014Ronald Reagan couldn't do it. No President was able to do it. I got it.And the first week in office, the Biden administration terminated that. ANWR is the biggest site, probably bigger than Saudi Arabia. We don't know yet. But it's of that size or bigger. And we hit gold, and I call it liquid gold. But we hit gold. And they\u2014for whatever reason, they terminated it. And we were just ready to start utilizing it.This could take care of all of Asia energy-wise. Very close to Japan. In fact, Japan wants to go and be our partner doing the pipeline going right into the ships. So they expressed tremendous interest. So did Prime Minister Modi of India.And just in closing, both Prime Minister Modi and the Prime Minister of Japan\u2014both very good people\u2014they said: \"We couldn't make a deal. We couldn't get any energy.\" I mean, you wonder what was going on with our country. They couldn't make a deal to get energy\u2014any energy from the Biden administration. They just couldn't do it. There was nobody to deal with. They didn't know how to go about it. And they're very happy that we're here.But we're going to really benefit our taxpayers, and we're going to benefit our country.So I want to thank everybody for coming. This is a very big bill. This is really going to be energy dominant. We're going to be energy dominant like nobody else. And this doesn't even discuss all of the electricity that we're going to be producing for all of the AI plants.You know, they need double the electricity, at least, that we have right now. So you take all of our electricity that we have all over the country just for AI, to do it right and to win that war, which we're leading by a lot because of what we've done over the last few weeks. We're leading by, actually, a lot. But if you take all of it, we have to double our electricity needs just for the AI, and that doesn't include the other technologies.So it's a real honor to sign this bill. We're going to also work on CAFE standards. Lee, you're going to be doing that and make that whole situation\u2014bring that back into reality and, I think, very quickly\u2014having to do with cars.Thank you very much.[The President signed an Executive order titled, \"Establishing the National Energy Dominance Council.\"]India-U.S. Trade RelationsQ. Did Modi cut any tariffs yesterday as part of your meeting, sir?The President. No. But in 2 weeks, we will have another one. Yesterday was very big. Reciprocal tariffs was very big. And it\u2014I explained to the Prime Minister of India\u2014PrimeMinister Modi; very good man\u2014his tariffs are very, very high. India's tariffs are among the highest.And I said, \"Well, now, you know\"\u2014we were very low. We were the lowest. They're just about the highest. There are others as high, but not much higher. And I said: \"No, no. From now on, what we do is what you charge us, we charge you. It's very simple. So whatever you're charging us\u2014you can go as high as you want. Whatever you charge us, we charge you.\"Q. Did he make any pledges about BRICS?The President. And I wouldn't say they were thrilled to hear that, but that's the way it is. Tariff, I told you, is a beautiful word. Fourth most beautiful.U.S. Trade Policy\/U.S. Dollar\/Domestic Energy ProductionQ. Did he make any pledges about BRICS nations not undermining the dollar? You had threatened\u2014\u2014The President. Yes. Yes.Q. \u2014\u2014a hundred-percent tariffs.The President. BRICS. The BRICS nations, I think that's breaking up very rapidly. We said that if they're going to go and do anything to undermine the dollar\u2014that includes China. I don't even know that they're a member of BRICS. But they had a few nations get together to try and play cute. And I said, \"We're going to put a hundred-percent tariff on every one of those nations.\" And at the mere thought of saying that, I think that's all broken up, that idea has no longer sailed.No, that would be a terrible thing for our country. It'd be bad for the world. They wanted to undermine the dollar. Six nations got together. They wanted to undermine the dollar. That doesn't\u2014that didn't work out too well. Not going to happen. And we're getting along with a lot of nations now, frankly. There's a lot of respect for the United States.We have regained our\u2014the respect that we should have. And\u2014but we've also done things to deserve it. I mean, we freed up our country, and you're going to see this is basically energy dominance. And it's going to be environmentally clean, environmentally wonderful, and taxes will be very reasonable based on this.We're going to make more money than anybody has ever made with energy. We have more energy than anybody else, and it's clean energy\u2014very clean, beautiful energy. We're lucky we have it. I call it liquid gold under our feet. And we're going to utilize it.So this is a very big bill, and the\u2014I have a very talented group of people behind me. This gentleman was the number-one man in all of the oil industry. They said, \"There's nobody like him.\" Chris. Chris Wright.And you know Doug. Doug actually made a tremendous fortune in technology. And he said, \"I'm going to run for the Governorship of\"\u2014he loves his State\u2014\"of North Dakota.\" And he did, and he made it so energy powerful that he's\u2014I think he's\u2014I think you're more proficient at energy than technology. But what do I know?And this guy, everybody knows him. Sean. He's been\u2014he's done a fast study on transportation, and he knows\u2014he's learned a lot over the last few months. He's learned a lot. He's really been great.And Howard has built one of the great companies, Cantor Fitzgerald. It was wiped out\u2014 completely wiped out, other than a few people left in Europe\u2014and he rebuilt the company into a bigger, better company. Cantor Fitzgerald was\u2014is one of the most\u2014absolutely, one of the topcompanies on Wall Street\u2014stocks, bonds, trading. And he took that\u2014I mean, he literally watched the plane go into the building, go into the World Trade Center. Amazing story. That alone is an amazing story.He was delayed because his wife insisted that he finally, after years, take his child to school. So he took his child to school that one day, because normally he would have been in the building at 6 o'clock in the morning. That's that business, right? So you owe your wife a lot and your child\u2014\u2014Secretary Lutnick. I do.The President. \u2014\u2014a lot. Right?Secretary Lutnick. I do.The President. But his wife insisted that he take his child to school. For 5 years, he didn't do it. He was horrible. What kind of a father was he? [Laughter] \"Okay, I'll do it.\" And he took\u2014and he was, therefore, driving down at 8:43, whatever the time was, down the West Side Highway, and he saw the plane go into the side of the building. He said, \"Wow.\" And he occupied the top three floors of the World Trade Center\u2014of the one building of the World Trade Center. And you know what happened there. He lost a hundred-percent of the people in that. All\u2014his whole company was there. And he rebuilt his company step by step over years and became bigger and stronger, and he gave a tremendous amount of the profit to the families of the people that died, which he didn't have to do. And now he's working with us.He did an incredible job. I mean, anybody in that world, they know Howard Lutnick very well. And I'm honored to have him running Commerce. He's going to be incredible. And he loves it. He loves the country.And Lee was a great lawyer, a great Congressman, very successful person, both as a lawyer and as a Congressman, and knows a lot about the environment, cares about the environment, and we were lucky that\u2014I was very happy that you joined. And he\u2014\u2014Administrator Zeldin. Thank you for the call.The President. \u2014\u2014he was with me right from the beginning. Always was with me. And I've always been with him.And Kevin Hassett, we know. He's\u2014everybody knows Kevin, and he's fantastic.And you and\u2014Lindsey, you and your team are incredible. The job you've did\u2014\u2014we\u2014 done, we really appreciate. Thank Will. And the job you guys are doing is really fantastic. We're knocking this out.Brian [Brian Glenn, America's Real Voice], do you have a question?Liquified Natural Gas\/Domestic Energy ProductionQ. I actually do. I wanted\u2014what kind of piqued my interest is, growing up on the Texas Gulf Coast, natural gas, the LNG that you mentioned\u2014\u2014The President. Yes.Q. \u2014\u2014what's the potential for, like, new jobs or growth in that area? I mean, because that's\u2014that part of the country\u2014Southwest Louisiana, Southeast Texas\u2014they depend on that.Secretary Wright. I would say that that potential is simply tremendous. You know, 20 years ago, the United States was the biggest importer of natural gas in the world, and we had natural gas prices two or three times higher than they are today. But with shale revolution and great entrepreneurs in Texas and Louisiana and across our great country, we are now, today, the largestnet exporter of natural gas in the world, and so much of the world is depending upon\u2014natural gas is the fastest growing energy source. Has been for 50 years. We were the driver of that, and then we paused.We stopped our ability to grow natural gas exports. Both the Japanese Government and Indian Government expressed great distress about that. They're going to count on energy imports from the U.S., and we may just change our mind. So I think they're thrilled to see the actions of this President say America is open for business.Yes, we have the energy. We have the people. We have huge job opportunities and investment opportunities, not just in the oil and gas industry, but all those surrounding communities that are lifted up by that more production here.And as we produce more production at scale, not only does it allow us to export, but it becomes more efficient, and it helps us drive down the cost for our domestic consumers as well.Q. Yes, I know they're really happy. To just let you\u2014[laughter]\u2014\u2014The President. They are, very happy.Q. \u2014\u2014on behalf of Southeast Texas, thank you, because I grew up in that area.The President. Thank you, Brian.Q. Thank you.The President. And I will say this, that this all started 8 years ago when I got elected. We were doing this\u2014not to the extent that we're doing it now, but we were doing this, and we became number one in oil and gas by far.Secretary Wright. By far.The President. And we were number three, even number four\u2014some would say we\u2014when I left, we were number one by a lot. And then they pulled way back, and the prices started going through the roof. And then they went back to my plan. But by that time, the prices had already gone up, so they really disrupted it. But now we're going to take it to a new level.It's going to be amazing, and we're also\u2014it's very powerful: clean coal. We have more coal than anybody. This is good, beautiful, clean coal.And if you notice, China is opening up a coal plant a month. Germany is now opening up a coal plant every 2 months. Very powerful. It's probably the most powerful source of energy in terms of generation\u2014generation of electricity and other things. And we're going to utilize our good, clean, beautiful coal and oil and gas. We're\u2014we have more than anybody of everything, and we're going to take advantage of it.And I appreciate everybody being here.[Several reporters began asking questions at once.]Q. On the energy\u2014\u2014The President. Yes. Please.Senator Roger F. Wicker\/Secretary of Defense Peter B. HegsethQ. Can I ask you\u2014can I ask you, sir, about what's happening in Munich? Senator Roger Wicker shepherded Defense Secretary Hegseth through his confirmation. He got him through that process, and then he had some tough words for him overseas. He said it was a \"rookie mistake\" for Secretary Hegseth to outline what would or would not happen as far as Ukraine's membership in NATO goes.The President. I\u2014\u2014Q. And then\u2014\u2014The President. I haven't heard that. I mean, Roger is a very good friend of mine and Pete is\u2014obviously, he's been doing a great job. I haven't heard\u2014\u2014Q. Did you know what he was going to say?The President. Let me\u2014let me look at\u2014you're telling me something I'm\u2014I have not heard about.Q. The question I had is, were you aware of what Secretary Hegseth was going to say in his speech at NATO?The President. Generally speaking, yes. Generally speaking, I was. I'll speak to Roger. I'll speak to Pete. I'll find out.Q. Mr. President\u2014\u2014Domestic Energy Production\/Energy InfrastructureQ. On the energy dominance council. That\u2014\u2014The President. Yes.Q. \u2014\u2014is for all forms of energy? Does that include\u2014\u2014The President. All forms of energy.Q. \u2014\u2014wind and solar?The President. Yes.Q. And the pipeline you mentioned, sir, is that Constitution Pipeline in New York? Can you\u2014\u2014Secretary Burgum. Yes.Q. \u2014\u2014is that the project it's going to be? The President. I believe it\u2014yes. Secretary Burgum. Yes.The President. Yes, that's what it is. And, you know, they've been trying to get it for 20 years. And what it means is, for New York\u2014Upstate New York and even everywhere in New York\u2014also other States, but, in particular, New England\u2014that New England will now\u2014I think will cut the energy prices, and big cuts in New York too, but cut the energy prices literally in half. We have the permits. We have permits that\u2014just about everything we need\u2014a New York permit. And I would imagine they want to do it, because their energy prices will come down so\u2014so far. And it's a lot of jobs for New York. It's a great thing for New York. Everybody wants it.We'll be meeting with the various Governors\u2014the Governor of New York and the other Governors too, and we can have it built in about 9 months\u2014let's say 1 year. But we can actually have it built in pretty close to 9 months. It's all set. We have most of the permits\u2014almost all of the permits.U.S. Steel Production\/TariffsQ. And on\u2014just\u2014you're prioritizing energy dominance today. You've also prioritized trade balance. The oil industry is a little worried about the steel tariffs. I mean, they put 20,000 feet of steel in the ground at a well. How will you balance that? Is there a possibility for an exemption?The President. You're talking about steel and aluminum?Q. Indeed, steel tariffs. Yes.The President. So the steel\u2014I saved the steel industry in my first term by putting on tariffs, because China was dumping massive amounts of steel\u2014others also, but mostly China. And I put very substantial\u2014we took in 600 billion dollars' worth of tariffs from China. No other President has taken up\u2014literally haven't gotten 10 cents from China. Not 10 cents.And hundreds of billions of dollars came in from China, and they understood it. They understood what I did.But the dumping stopped. And had I not done that, you wouldn't have one steel mill\u2014I think I can say\u2014not one steel mill operating in this country, and we need steel. We need steel. I mean, there are some things you have to have, and steel is one of them for military, et cetera.So I think steel is going to be very strong. It's going to be very strong. I think it will go back to being really powerful. We saved it.It\u2014I mean, we were talking about U.S. Steel last week. We\u2014U.S. Steel would have been closed\u2014totally closed. We saved it, and now it's going to become, I think, very, very profitable.The tariffs are going to save a lot of industries.Q. Mr. President\u2014\u2014U.S. Steel Corporation\/Nippon SteelQ. Can I just follow up on U.S. Steel, just very quickly, sir?The President. Yes, go\u2014go ahead. Yes, finish up. Go ahead.Q. Do you\u2014is\u2014if the Japanese company that's interested in U.S. Steel wants to take a minority stake as opposed to full ownership, is that fine with you?The President. A minority stake I wouldn't mind greatly. But what they're doing right now is, they're going to be investors, and they're going to be investing in, I think, debt and various other things. But we didn't want to let U.S. Steel go to a foreign company.And U.S. Steel was the greatest company in the world for a period of 15 years. It was\u2014you know, it was the big deal 80 years ago or so. And psychologically, we can't\u2014we can't even think about letting that happen.But what is going to happen\u2014and we've already seen it\u2014you see it in the stock price\u2014with the tariffs, U.S. Steel is going to be a real powerhouse again.Vice President James D. \"J.D.\" Vance\/EuropeQ. Mr. President, can I just follow up on Jacqui's [Jacqui Heinrich, Fox News] question about Munich? Vice President Vance's speech to the conference has ruffled quite a few feathers in Europe.The President. What did he say to ruffle them? I don't\u2014\u2014Q. He was talking about the freedom of speech and migration in Europe. Do you believe that European leaders have a fundamentally different view of the world than this administration's?The President. Well, I heard his speech, and I tell you\u2014you're talking about J.D.'s speech, right?Q. Yes, sir.The President. I heard his speech, and he talked about freedom of speech, and\u2014I think it's true in Europe. It's losing\u2014they're losing their wonderful right of freedom of speech. I see it. I mean\u2014I thought he made a very good speech\u2014actually, a very brilliant speech. Yes. And Europe has to be careful.And he talked about immigration, and Europ"

Trump, 2025Remarks Following a Document Signing Ceremony and an Exchange With Reporters in Palm Beach, FloridaFebruary 18, 2025The President. I want to thank some of the great people from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. They're here to take photographs, and it's my honor to do so. Also, the fire department, the great firefighters. So they're here throughout the room, and I want to thank you very much for being here. I'll be with you in a little while. We'll do some great photos. We have plenty of time.Policemen, policewomen, and firemen, firewomen\u2014they're here, and we appreciate it very much. You've done a fantastic job.Oh, I think it's very important to state that incredible things are happening in our country. I think we've made more progress in 3 weeks than they've made in 4 years, especially with respect to the reputation of our country, and people are respecting us again as a country and as a powerful country and maybe a smart country.But maybe not so smart, because when you look at some of the waste, fraud, and abuse that's being uncovered by DOGE and the people at DOGE\u2014these are young\u2014often young, but super brilliant people, incredible computer scientists and other things. And they're finding levels of fraud and waste and abuse like, I think, nobody ever thought possible.But before we do that, I just want to ask Will to come over. We've\u2014I've just finished signing some Executive orders. And if we could start with that, Will, you might want to come up here and just explain what we did.Thank you.White House Staff Secretary William O. Scharf. Good afternoon, y'all. A short while ago, President Trump signed three items.The first is an Executive order relating to the affordability and availability of in vitro fertilization and other fertility treatments. These are treatments that have become unaffordable for many Americans or have been unaffordable for many Americans. And the Executive order is a directive to the Domestic Policy Council to examine ways to make IVF and other fertility treatments more affordable for more Americans.The second item that we signed was a Presidential memorandum imposing radical transparency requirements on Government departments and agencies in keeping with President Trump and the administration's broader commitment to Governmental transparency. What this Presidential memorandum would do is require\u2014as waste, fraud, and abuse is uncovered, as programs are canceled, and, ultimately, as taxpayer dollars are saved, this Presidential memorandum would require departments and agencies to make all of the details of that freely available to the public.Lastly, we have another Executive order that President Trump signed relating to independent agencies. This Executive order would establish important oversight functions in the Office of Management and Budget and its subsidiary office, OIRA, supervising independent agencies and many of their actions and also reestablishes the long-standing norm that only the President or the attorney general can speak for the United States when stating an opinion as to what the law is.The President. All right. Thank you very much, Will. That was the primary purpose of this conference to explain that they are all very important in their own way.Fertilization\u2014I've been saying that we're going to do what we have to do, and I think the women\u2014and families, husbands\u2014are very appreciative of it.But that was it.I do want to say while I'm up here, I've been contacted by some of the biggest companies in the world, and because of what we're doing economically and through tariffs and taxes and incentives, they want to come back into the United States. And we'll be announcing various very large companies\u2014the biggest, actually. And they'll be coming back, having to do with chips and having to do also with cars and lots of other things.We're going to be announcing some very, very big\u2014very big\u2014momentous, I think\u2014 momentous decisions are being made by companies all around the world\u2014the biggest\u2014and they want to come back into the U.S.Car plants are being canceled in other locations now because they want to build them here. And you read about a couple\u2014not that I want to mention names or anything\u2014but you read about a couple of big ones in Mexico just got canceled because they're going to be building them in the United States. And that's very simply because of what we're doing with respect to taxes, tariffs, and incentives.And I think it's a very important thing. And you'll be seeing this over the next\u2014probably over the next 2 years, to be honest, but you're going to see a lot of it over the next couple of weeks. A lot of big ones are be\u2014going to be announcing.And so, while we're here, I guess we can take a couple of quick questions. Go ahead, please. Please.TariffsQ. Mr. President, have you decided specifically what the auto tariff rate should be?The President. Yes, I probably will tell you that in\u2014on April 2, but it will be in the neighborhood of 25 percent.Q. And what about semiconductors and pharmaceuticals?The President. It will be 25 percent and higher, and it will go very substantially higher over a course of a year. But we want to give them time to come in, because, as you know, when they come into the United States and they have their plant or factory here, there is no tariff. So, we want to give them a little bit of a chance.Yes, thank you.European UnionQ. Just following up on that. The EU\u2014I'm sorry. Andrea Shalal [Reuters]. The EU representative is going to be here in Washington next week\u2014I'm sorry, tomorrow. He's going to be meeting with Hassett and Greer and Lutnick.What can the EU do to sort of avoid the reciprocal tariffs that you've talked about? And, you know, you've talked a lot about the VAT. Do you expect them to reduce that?The President. Well, they did already, as I understand it, reduce their car tariff all the way down to what we have. And a lot of that will take place, and I think some won't do it and some will do it.But the EU had a 10-percent tax on cars, and now they have a 2.5-percent tax, which is the exact same as us. So, already, we've saved a tremendous amount. That would be great\u2014if everybody would do that, then we'd all be on the same playing field. Because essentially, what we're doing with the tariffs is, you know, they charge us, we charge them. Same amount. And I\u2014 it's called reciprocal, actually, and whatever they charge us, we're charging them.And so the EU is\u2014you know, I appreciate that they did this, but you know, the EU has been very unfair to us. We have a deficit of $350 billion. They don't take our cars. They don't take our farm products. They don't take almost anything. They take very little. And we're going to have to straighten that out, and we will. I have no doubt about it.Yes, go ahead, please.Russia\/UkraineQ. Thanks. Thank you, Mr. President. Can you tell us a little bit more about the Russia talks, your impression of\u2014\u2014The President. Yes.Q. \u2014\u2014how they went today\u2014\u2014The President. Sure.Q. \u2014\u2014and if you're perhaps more confident or less confident of a deal after what happened today?The President. Well, much more confident. They were very good. Russia wants to do something. They want to stop the savage barbarianism. I mean, what\u2014what's going on over there, it's\u2014soldiers are being killed by the thousands on a weekly basis. It's ridiculous. And they're not American soldiers. They're Russian soldiers and they're Ukrainian soldiers, largely, although a lot of Koreans have been killed, as you know\u2014quite a bit of them have been killed. They came over to fight, and a large portion have been wiped out.But we want to\u2014we want to end it. It was\u2014it's a senseless war. It should have never happened. It would have never happened if I was President. And it's a shame to see it.And I see pictures that you don't see, but I see pictures of fields that look\u2014just horrible. It looks like Gettysburg. If you see the old pictures of Gettysburg, it's soldiers lying all over the field, body parts all over the field. They're all dead. And this is going on on a daily basis. It's a horrible thing. Both Russia and Ukraine\u2014they're losing thousands and thousands of soldiers, and a lot of people have been killed too.I think that's one of the things that will\u2014you'll see historically and you'll see later on as it goes along. I think people are going to be surprised at how many people, not only soldiers, have been killed in Ukraine. A lot more people than you think.Yes, please.U.S. Servicemembers Stationed in EuropeQ. President Trump, as part of a peace deal with Putin, would you be willing to consider removing all American troops from Europe?The President. Well, nobody has asked me to do that, so I don't think we'd have to do that. I wouldn't want to do that. But that question has never really come up.Q. Sir\u2014\u2014The President. Yes. Please.Ukraine\/RussiaQ. Sir, do you support stationing European peacekeeping troops in Ukraine as part of this peace deal?The President. If they want to do that, that's great. I'm all for it. If they want to do that, I think that's\u2014that'd be fine.Q. Even if the Russians are opposed\u2014\u2014The President. I mean, I know France has mentioned it, others have mentioned it.Q. Even if the Russians are\u2014\u2014The President. U.K. has mentioned it. But yes, if\u2014well, if we have a peace deal, I think having troops over there for\u2014from the standpoint of Europe\u2014we won't have to put any over there, because, you know, we're very far away, but having troops over there would be fine. I would not object to it at all.We're talking about this now: peace. We have either a cease-fire or a peace itself, and we're looking to do both. Would start off with the cease-fire. And if they want to do that\u2014I know France was willing to do that, and I thought that was a beautiful gesture.Yes, please.Ukraine\/Russia\/Hamas Attacks of October 7, 2023, on Israel\/InflationQ. Sir, do you have any message for Ukrainians who, after 3 years of fighting, might feel betrayed or disappointed at not having a seat at these initial talks in Saudi Arabia?The President. Well, I think I'm really disappointed in what's happened. I've been watching this for 3 years. It's a war that would have never happened if I was President. And I've been watching these\u2014these, you know, people being killed at levels that you've rarely seen\u2014not\u2014not even close since the Second World War, and I'm very disappointed. I hear that, you know, they're upset about not having a seat. Well, they've had a seat for 3 years and a long time before that.This could have been settled very easily. Just a half\u2014a half-baked negotiator could have settled this years ago without\u2014I think, without the loss of much land, very little land; without the loss of any lives; and without the loss of cities that are just laying on their sides.You have those magnificent golden domes that are shattered, will never be replaced. You can't replace them. Thousand-year-old domes that are so beautiful. You can't replace that. A whole civilization has changed because of what\u2014so, when they're worried about not being seated, you mean somebody that should have gone in and made a deal a long time ago. You could have made a deal. This is one that could have made a deal. There was no talk of this during the Trump administration. Putin would have never, ever done it.And by the way, we wouldn't have had October 7. You know that. We wouldn't have had October 7 either in Israel, and we wouldn't have that mess that's going on over there.It's like you\u2014we have great fire people here. We're putting out fires. All over the world, we're putting out fires. So that wouldn't have happened.And you know what else wouldn't have happened? Inflation, because it was caused, really, by the cost of energy going through the roof because of their bad energy policies, and\u2014and also their spending\u2014their terrible spending, wasteful spending on the \"green new scam.\" It's a scam. It's a whole big scam.Yes, please.Associated Press\/Geographic NamesQ. Yes, sir. I want to ask you a little closer to home. What would it take for you to reconsider the restrictions on the Associated Press?And secondly, some of your advisers are concerned with the Associated Press's style guide, using language and giving guidance to not use words like \"illegal immigrant\" or to use phrases like \"gender-affirming care,\" and they're concerned about that being an encroaching amount of liberalism in the way in which the press writes about things. Do you share those concerns?The President. Well, I do think that some of the phrases that they want to use are ridiculous, and I think, frankly, they've become obsolete, especially in the last 3 weeks, because many things have happened in the last 3 weeks.And I didn't know about that, but I would say that if they want to use certain phrases like that\u2014and I guess some are okay, but many aren't.But the Associated Press just refuses to go with what the law is and what has taken place. It's called the Gulf of America now. It's not called the Gulf of Mexico any longer. I have the right to do it, just like we have the right to do Mount McKinley, and nobody is even challenging that. But only the Associated\u2014essentially, it's primarily the Associated Press, and I don't know what they're doing, but I just say that we're going to keep them out until such time as they agree that it's the Gulf of America. We're very proud of this country, and we want it to be the Gulf of America.Now, the Associated Press, as you know, has been very, very wrong on the election, on Trump, and the treatment of Trump, and other things having to do with Trump and Republicans and conservatives. And they're doing us no favors, and I guess I'm not doing them any favors. That's the way life works.But you know, thank you for the question. Who are you with?Q. Axios, sir.The President. It's a very good question. [Laughter] Thank you. Yes.Ukraine\/Russia\/Gaza, Palestinian Territories\/North Atlantic Treaty OrganizationQ. Thank you, Mr. President. We're hearing that Russia wants to force Ukraine to hold new elections in order to sign any kind of a peace deal. Is that something that the U.S. would ever support?The President. Well, we have a situation where we haven't had elections in Ukraine; where we have martial law\u2014essentially martial law in Ukraine; where the leader in Ukraine\u2014I mean, I hate to say it, but he's down at 4 percent approval rating; and where a country has been blown to smithereens.You've got\u2014most of the cities are laying on their sides. The buildings are collapsed. It looks like a massive demolition site. The whole\u2014I mean, so many of the cities\u2014I mean, they haven't done it in Kyiv, because, I guess they don't want to shoot too many rockets in there. They've done it 20 percent, but they haven't done it 100 percent. If they wanted to do it 100 percent, it would probably happen very quickly. But you have cities that are absolutely decimated.And yes, I would say that, you know, when they want a seat at the table, you could say, the people have to\u2014wouldn't the people of Ukraine have to say, like, you know, \"It's been a long time since we've had an election\"?That's not a Russia thing. That's something coming from me and coming from many other countries also.Q. Would you be concerned about Russia putting up a puppet\u2014\u2014The President. You know, Ukraine is being just\u2014just wiped out. Look at what's happening to the cities. That\u2014there are cities, there's not even a building standing. It's a massive\u2014it's\u2014you talk about Gaza. I mean, it's\u2014it's\u2014literally, these cities look like Gaza. Actually, many have, percentage-wise, more buildings knocked down than in Gaza.So, you know, people are tired of it. People want to see something happen.And you know, the other thing that\u2014it's been bothering me for a long time, because I\u2014I solved the problem with NATO. They paid hundreds of billions of dollars into the funds of NATO when I said, \"You got to pay,\" because the United States was paying for European countries, and then they take advantage of us on trade.But I've seen it. Look, we have to\u2014they have to pay. They have to find out, where is the money going to? We have\u2014I believe President Zelenskyy said last week that he doesn't know where half of the money is that we gave him. Well, we gave them, I believe, $350 billion, but let's say it's something less than that. But it's a\u2014it's a lot.And we have to equalize with Europe, because Europe has given us a\u2014given a very much smaller percentage than that. I think Europe has given $100 billion, and we've given, let's say, 300-plus, and it's more important for them than it is for us. We have an ocean in between, and they don't.But where is all the money that's been given? Where is it going? And nobody\u2014I've never seen an accounting of it. We give hundreds of billions of dollars. I have\u2014I\u2014I don't see any\u2014any accounting.So I want to see peace. Look, you know why I want? Because I don't want all these people killed anymore. I'm looking at people that are being killed, and they're Russian and Ukrainian people, but they're people\u2014doesn't matter where they're from on the whole planet. And I think I have the power to end this war, and I think it's going very well.But today I heard, \"Oh, well, we weren't invited.\" Well, you've been there for 3 years. You should have ended it 3 years\u2014you should have never started it. You could have made a deal.I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land\u2014 everything\u2014almost all of the land, and no people would have been killed, and no city would have been demolished, and not one dome would have been knocked down. But they chose not to do it that way.And President Biden, in all fairness, he doesn't have a clue. What he\u2014he was so bad for this.He was so bad, so pathetic, and so sad.But with all of that being said, look, we\u2014it is what it is.When I left, there was no chance that this could have happened, but it happened because we had incompetent leadership at many different levels.But when you see what's taken place in Ukraine, with millions of people killed, including the soldiers\u2014millions of people killed, a big percentage of their cities knocked down to the ground. I don't know how anybody even lives there.You know, when they say they took a poll and Zelenskyy is at 4 percent, who's living there? You know, I mean, people are\u2014it's hard to believe that people live there. Their cities are being knocked down.And this is something that would have never happened. And by the way, for 4 years, it didn't happen. It was never going to happen.Go ahead.Ukraine\/RussiaQ. Can I ask one follow-up question? How would you counter the perception\u2014because Russia is pushing for this, obviously; they don't really hold true elections\u2014that that would be a capitulation of some sort? How would you guard against, potentially, Russia installing a puppet Government?And then, finally, how would that new election have an impact on getting Zelenskyy to sign the rare earth minerals deal?The President. Look, you have leadership\u2014and I like him personally. He's fine. But I don't care about personally. I care about getting the job done.You have leadership now that's allowed a war to go on that should have never even happened, even without the United States. Look, we had a President who was grossly incompetent. He had no idea what he was doing. He said some very stupid things, like going in for portions and all of the things. He made a lot of bad statements. But he's grossly incompetent, and I think everyone knew that.This is something that should have never happened\u2014would have never happened. And I used to discuss it with Putin. President Putin and I would talk about Ukraine. It was the apple of his eye, I will tell you that. But he never\u2014there was never a chance of him going in.And I told him: \"You'd better not go in. Don't go in. Don't go in.\" And he understood that, and he understood it fully. But I'm only interested\u2014I want to see if I can save maybe millions of lives. This could even end up in a World War III, I mean, to be honest with you.You've been hearing\u2014now Europe is saying, \"Well, I think we're going to go in, and we're going to go.\" All of a sudden, you're going to end up in World War III over something that should have never happened. And you know, it's a very sad situation.Yes, please.White House Senior Adviser Elon R. Musk\/Ukraine\/Social Security Program\/Government Regulations\/U.S. Foreign Assistance ProgramsQ. Mr. President, in a court filing, the White House said that Elon Musk is not a DOGE employee and has no authority to make decisions. Can you clarify for us today\u2014\u2014The President. Well, Elon Musk\u2014\u2014Q. \u2014\u2014what his exact role is there?The President. Yes, yes. Elon is, to me, a patriot. So, you know, you could call him an employee. You could call him a consultant. You could call him whatever you want. But he's a patriot.I mean, look at the kind of things\u2014I just said, \"Just write it down, just in case that question got asked.\" Right? And which\u2014I'm surprised it took so long, actually.But you know what? Ukraine is a bigger deal, because people are dying by the thousands a week\u2014thousands. But look at this. From 90 to 99, Social Security: 6,054,000 people. Well, that's okay. Maybe that's possible. You know, 90 to 99. Maybe it's possible. It's a lot of people, though, with that.But people that live to 100 to 109: 4,734,000. Wow, that's a lot. That means over 100 years old. There are 4 million people. I don't know\u2014I don't know too many. I know people that are doing great in their nineties, but not too many people over 100. But over 120\u2014from 120 years old\u2014people that are 120 years old, up to 129: 3,472,000 people. Wow.You know that can't possibly be because the record is like\u2014I think it's one person\u2014a woman lived to 127. But they have 3,472\u2014okay.But now we're going really in. People from 130 years old to 139 years old: 3,936,000. Wow. I wonder if people are getting paid with all this. I mean, are these checks\u2014and that's what we're checking right now.People from 140 years old to 149 years old: 3,542,000. A hundred and forty years old and beyond. Now we're really going because we're looking to break the record by 25 years. People from 150 years old to 159 years old: 1,345,000. These are in the\u2014by the way, these are in the computer files.These are\u2014this is what they do well. They're super\u2014I asked Elon, \"Who are these DOGE people?\" He said they're super brilliant computer people, and they love the country.It's simple.Q. Does he\u2014\u2014The President. Wait a minute. People from 160 years old to 169 years: 121,000. So 160- year-old people. A hundred and seventy to a hundred and seventy-nine thousand: six thousand oh-eighty-seven.But now let's go into the real numbers. From 200 to 209 years old: 879 people. From 210 years old\u2014I haven't met any of them. And if I did, I'd\u2014I would bless them. I would worship the ground they walk on. Two hundred and ten to two hundred and nineteen years: eight hundred and sixty-six.From 220 years old to 229 years old: 1,039. And then, you have two people\u2014from 240 years old to 249 years old: one person. And there's one person that's 360 years old.That's just that. And then, where's the money being spent? Right? Let's go into that for just a second.Five hundred and twenty million dollars for a consultant on the environment. It's called environmental, social, and governance, investments in Africa and mobilize private-sector resources: $520 million. Somebody got $520 million for an environmental\u2014sounds like an environmental study. That's the most\u2014I've always been one that paid a lot of money for my environmental studies, but they\u2014you know, I paid like $50,000 not $520 million. Five hundred and twenty million dollars for ESG.Twenty-five million dollars to promote biodiversity, conservation, and promote licit livelihoods by developing socially responsible behavior in the country of Colombia. Well, that's nice. Twenty-five million going to Colombia for something that nobody ever heard of.Forty million dollars to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants. Forty million. Forty-two million dollars for Johns Hopkins\u2014great place\u2014to research and drive social and behavior change in Uganda. Forty-two million. What about us? What about social change in our country?Seventy million dollars for a center at Purdue to research university-sourced, evidence-based solutions to developmental challenges. I mean, these are massive numbers on things that nobody ever heard about.Ten million dollars for Mozambique voluntary medical male circumcisions. Ten million dollars for circumcisions in another country.Nine-point-seven million for UC Berkeley to develop a cohort of Cambodian youth with enterprise-driven skills. In other words, let's teach them something about enterprise. What about our people? Can't we teach them about enterprise? Two-point-three million for strengthening independent voices in Cambodia.Thirty-two million dollars to the Prague Civil Society Centre, which is a very liberal group of people. I wonder how much of that money came back to the people that approved it. Fourteen million dollars for improving public procurement in Serbia. Four hundred eighty-six million dollars to the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening, including $22 million for inclusive and participatory political process in Moldova.And $21 million for voter turnout in India. Well, why are we giving $21 million to India?They've got a lot of money. They're the\u2014one of the highest taxing countries in the world in terms of us. We can hardly get in there because their tariffs are so high. I have a lot of respect for India. I have a lot of respect for the Prime Minister. He just left, as you know, 2 days ago. But we're giving $21 million for voter turnout. It's voter turnout in India. What about, like, voter turnout here? Oh, we've done that, I guess. We did $500 million, didn't we? It's called the lockboxes.Q. But closer to home\u2014\u2014The President. Twenty million dollars for fiscal federalism in Nepal. Listen to these numbers. These are\u2014this is all fraud. Nineteen million dollars for biodiversity conservation in Nepal.One-point-five million for voter confidence\u2014we want to give them confidence\u2014in Liberia.Fourteen million dollars for social cohesion in Mali. Two-point-five million for inclusive democracies in South Africa.Forty-seven million dollars for improving learning outcomes in Asia. Asia is doing very well. They're doing a lot better than we do in the schools, aren't they?Two million dollars to develop sustainable recycling models to increase socioeconomic cohesion among marginalized communities in Kosovo and Ashkali and in Egypt.We're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars. I could\u2014I could\u2014by the way, I could read this all day long. I could go on all day long, and you'll see hundreds of billions of dollars. And we're doing it.But when I saw the Social Security numbers, I said, \"Wow, that's really something.\" So we have\u2014let's just go above 100 years old. We have millions and millions of people over 100 years old. Everybody knows that's not so.We have a very corrupt country\u2014a very corrupt country. And it's a sad thing to say, but we're figuring it out.Now, the good thing about Social Security and what I read is if you take all of those numbers off, because they're obviously fraudulent or incompetent\u2014but if you take all of those millions of people off Social Security, all of a sudden, we have a very powerful Social Security with people that are 80 and 70 and 90, but not 200 years old. You know, so it's a very positive thing.How about over here? Yes, please.Social Security Administration Acting CommissionerQ. Your reaction to Michelle King, the head, resigning after the DOGE investigation?The President. Who resigned?Q. The head of Social Security.The President. I don't know. I mean, I\u2014resigned or got fired? I think got fired. You know, when you fire somebody, they always resign, and then they say, \"We resigned.\" But when you have numbers like that, I think, really, it's \"Got fired.\" They have to get fired. Who would keep them? How could you have numbers like this?Now, the big thing is, how many of these people got paid? Were they getting paid? Were they getting paid? How many of them were getting paid Social Security? Because that's\u2014if that's the case, it's a massive fraud.We'll have to call those great Palm Beach police into this situation, right? You guys would figure that out very quickly.But how many of them are being paid? I mean, maybe millions of them, but it's a total fraud. Also, a lot of illegal immigrants are on Social Security that shouldn't be there.Yes, please. Go ahead.Federal Workforce Reduction EffortsQ. Mr. President, there was a big wave of probationary Federal workers who were fired over the weekend. Some of these workers focused on nuclear weapons security were immediately rehired. Do you have any concerns about how these terminations have played out?The President. No, not at all. I think we have to just do what we have to do. It's\u2014you know, you're going to\u2014it's amazing what's been found right now. It's amazing.Yes, some\u2014if we feel that\u2014in some cases, they'll fire people and then they'll put some people back\u2014not all of them, because a lot of people were let go.Don't forget, I got elected on the basis of making our Government stronger and smaller, because we have millions of people that\u2014obviously, they're paying millions of people that shouldn't be paid. And that has also to do with workers.Yes, please. No, go ahead. Axios, New York Times.U.S. DOGE Service\/White House Senior Adviser Elon R. MuskQ. Sorry.Mr. President, given your concerns about corruption, you said that if there were any conflicts of interest with Elon Musk, you wouldn't\u2014\u2014The President. Yes.Q. \u2014\u2014let him anywhere near it.The President. That's right.Q. DOGE and SpaceX employees are now working directly at the Federal Aviation Administration and the Defense Department\u2014agencies that have billions of dollars in contracts with Musk's companies, or that directly regulate\u2014\u2014The President. Yes.Q. \u2014\u2014his companies. How is that not a conflict of interest?The President. Well, I mean, I'm just hearing about it, and if there is\u2014and he told me before I told him, but obviously, I will not let there be any conflict of interest.He's done an amazing job. They've revealed\u2014in fact, he's going to be on tonight a big show called \"Sean Hannity\" at 9 o'clock, and he's on, and I'm on, and we talk about a lot of different things.And any conflicts\u2014I told Elon, any conflicts, you can't have anything to do with that. So anything to do with possibly even space, we won't let Elon partake in that.Yes. Please.Guantanamo Bay, U.S. Naval Base Detention FacilityQ. On immigration, sir. You said you would be sending the worst of the worst to Guantanamo Bay. What we're finding out is that there are a lot of low-risk migrants who don't have a criminal background who are also being sent.The President. Yes.Q. Are you thinking about this differently now about who is being sent?The President. No, they're going to be brought back to their countries. And with some persuasion, every one of those countries\u2014every one in the\u2014as you know, every country is taking the people back. So some of them are going to be brought back to\u2014many of them\u2014any of them that are low-risk, as you say, are going to be brought back to their countries.Q. But why hold them in Guantanamo?The President. Yes, go ahead, please.VenezuelaQ. Can you give us a bit of an update on where you stand with Venezuela?The President. Yes. Sure.Q. Its oil\u2014there are\u2014there is, basically, a monthly license that can soon extend to a 6- month license.The President. Well, you know, we had Venezuela on the run, and it looked like that was going to be very good. And when Biden came in, as he always does, he screws it up. And they started buying millions and millions and millions of dollars of oil\u2014billions of dollars, actually, of oil. And it gave them a new lice\u2014a new, really, lease on life.And\u2014but we'll see. We had some pretty good discussions with a lot of people within our Government\u2014in the United States Government that are involved in that. And Venezuela is a little bit early. But you know, we were not buying from Venezuela.When Biden came in, for whatever reason, instead of just taking the beautiful, as I call it, liquid gold\u2014we have more than anybody\u2014they started paying a fortune to Venezuela. And we're looking at that actually. Why did they do that? Why were they doing that? Why would they go to the enemy and give them billions and billions of dollars?Now, with that being said, as you know, Venezuela has said very strongly, they will not take any\u2014"

Biden, Jr., 2025Remarks on the Terrorist Attack in New Orleans, Louisiana, and the Vehicular Explosion in Las Vegas, Nevada, From Camp David, MarylandJanuary 1, 2025Good evening.I know I can speak for all Americans when I say our hearts are with the people in New Orleans after the despicable attack that occurred in the early morning hours.To all the families of those who were killed, to all those who were injured, to all the people in New Orleans who are grieving today, I want you to know I grieve with you. Our Nation grieves with you. We're going to stand with you as you mourn and as you heal in the weeks to come.I want to thank our brave first responders and law enforcement personnel who stopped the attacker in his tracks before he could kill or injure even more people.And I want to thank you to everyone at the Department of the Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, including the FBI, for working nonstop to investigate this heinous act. The FBI is leading the investigation to determine what happened, why it happened, and whether there is any continuing threat to public safety.Here's what we know so far. The FBI has reported to me the killer was an American citizen, born in Texas. He served in the United States Army on Active Duty for many years. He also served in the Army Reserve until a few years ago.The FBI also reported to me that mere hours before the attack, he posted videos on social media indicating that he was inspired by ISIS, expressing a desire to kill\u2014a desire to kill. The ISIS flag was found in his vehicle, which he rented to conduct this attack. Possible explosives were found in the vehicle as well, and more explosives were near\u2014were found nearby.The situation is very fluid, and the investigation is at a preliminary stage. And the fact is that right now\u2014excuse me\u2014\u2014[At this point, the President flipped through some pages in a binder on the podium.]There you go\u2014the law enforcement and intelligence community are continuing to look for any connections, associations, or coconspirators.We have nothing additional to report at this time. The investigation is continuing to be active, and no one should jump to conclusions. I've directed my Attorney General, the FBI Director, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the head of the National Counterintelligence\u2014 terrorism Center, and the intelligence community to work on this intensively until we have a full and complete information. And once we have that information, I will share that information as soon as I\u2014we can confirm it.Additionally, we're tracking the explosion of a Cybertruck outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. Law enforcement and the intelligence community are investigating this as well, including whether there's any possible connection with the attack in New Orleans. Thus far, there's nothing to report on that score at this time.I directed my team to make sure every resource\u2014every resource\u2014is made available to Federal, State, and local law enforcement to complete the investigation in New Orleans quickly and to make sure there's no remaining threat to the American people.And we'll\u2014we will support the people in New Orleans as they begin the hard work of healing.New Orleans is a place unlike any other place in the world. It's a city full of charm and joy. So many people around the world love New Orleans because of its history, its culture, and above all, its people. So I know, while this person committed a terrible assault on the city, the spirit of our New Orleans will never, never, never be defeated. It always will shine forth.We've seen that time and time again throughout its history, and I know we'll see it again in the days and weeks ahead.May God bless the people of New Orleans. May our\u2014God bless our police and our first responders, and may God protect our troops.And we'll keep you fully, contemporaneously informed. Thank you.Q.

Biden, Jr., 2025Order\u2014Regarding the Proposed Acquisition of United States Steel Corporation by Nippon Steel CorporationJanuary 3, 2025By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (section 721), 50 U.S.C. 4565, it is hereby ordered as follows:Section 1. Findings. I hereby make the following findings:There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that (1) Nippon Steel Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of Japan (Nippon Steel); (2) Nippon Steel North America, Inc., a New York corporation (Nippon Steel NA); and (3) 2023 Merger Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with Nippon Steel and Nippon Steel NA, the Purchasers), through the proposed acquisition by the Purchasers of United States Steel Corporation, a Delaware corporation (U.S. Steel), might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States; andProvisions of law, other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), do not, in my judgment, provide adequate and appropriate authority for me to protect the national security in this matter.Sec. 2. Actions Ordered and Authorized. On the basis of the findings set forth in section 1 of this order, considering the factors set forth in subsection 721(f) of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as appropriate, and pursuant to my authority under applicable law, including section 721, I hereby order that:The proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by the Purchasers (Proposed Transaction) is prohibited, and any substantially similar transaction between the Purchasers and U.S. Steel, whether effected directly or indirectly by the Purchasers, through the Purchasers' shareholders or shareholders' immediate, intermediate, or ultimate foreign person beneficial owners, or through the Purchasers' partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates is also prohibited.The Purchasers and U.S. Steel shall take all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the Proposed Transaction no later than 30 days after the date of this order, unless such date is extended by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), on such conditions as CFIUS may require. Immediately upon completion of all steps necessary to abandon the Proposed Transaction, the Purchasers and U.S. Steel shall certify in writing to CFIUS that such abandonment has been effected in accordance with this order and that all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the Proposed Transaction have been completed.From the date of this order until the Purchasers and U.S. Steel provide a certification of abandonment of the Proposed Transaction to CFIUS pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Purchasers and U.S. Steel shall certify to CFIUS on a weekly basis that they are in compliance with this order and include with that certification a description of all efforts to fully and permanently abandon the Proposed Transaction, and a timeline for projected completion of remaining actions necessary to effectuate the abandonment.Any transaction or other instrument entered into or method employed for the purpose of, or with the effect of, evading or circumventing this order is prohibited.Without limitation on the exercise of authority by any agency under other provisions of law, and until such time as the Purchasers and U.S. Steel provide a certification of abandonmentof the Proposed Transaction and such certification is verified to the satisfaction of CFIUS, CFIUS is further authorized to implement measures it determines necessary and appropriate with regard to the Proposed Transaction to protect the national security of the United States, including measures available to it under section 721 and its implementing regulations, which include the remedies available for violations of any order, agreement or condition entered into or imposed under section 721.If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstances, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstances, is held to be invalid because of the lack of certain procedural requirements, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements.The Attorney General is authorized to take any steps necessary to enforce this order.Sec. 3. Reservation.

Biden, Jr., 2025Statement on the President's Order Regarding the Proposed Acquisition of United States Steel Corporation by Nippon Steel CorporationJanuary 3, 2025As I have said many times, steel production\u2014and the steel workers who produce it\u2014are the backbone of our Nation. A strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority and is critical for resilient supply chains. That is because steel powers our country: our infrastructure, our auto industry, and our defense industrial base. Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our Nation is less strong and less secure.For too long, U.S. steel companies have faced unfair trade practices as foreign companies have dumped steel on global markets at artificially low prices, leading to job losses and factory closures in America. I have taken decisive action to level the playing field for American steelworkers and steel producers by tripling tariffs on steel imports from China. With record investments in manufacturing, more than 100 new steel and iron mills have opened since I took office, and U.S. companies are producing the cleanest steel in the world. Today, the domestic steel industry is the strongest it has been in years.We need major U.S. companies representing the major share of U.S. steelmaking capacity to keep leading the fight on behalf of America's national interests. As a committee of national security and trade experts across the executive branch determined, this acquisition would place one of America's largest steel producers under foreign control and create risk for our national security and our critical supply chains.So that is why I am taking action to block this deal. It is my solemn responsibility as President to ensure that, now and long into the future, America has a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry that can continue to power our national sources of strength at home and abroad; and it is a fulfillment of that responsibility to block foreign ownership of this vital American company. U.S. Steel will remain a proud American company, one that's American- owned, American-operated, by American union steelworkers\u2014the best in the world.Today's action reflects my unflinching commitment to utilize all authorities available to me as President to defend U.S. national security, including by ensuring that American companies continue to play a central role in sectors that are critical for our national security. As I have made clear since day one: I will never hesitate to act to protect the security of this Nation and its infrastructure as well as the resilience of its supply chains.Categories: Statements by the President : United States Steel Corp., proposed acquisition by Nippon Steel Corp., President's order regarding.Subjects: China, trade with U.S.; Steel, domestic production, promotion efforts; United States Steel Corp., proposed acquisition by Nippon Steel Corp.DCPD Number: DCPD202500009.\n"

        "Content":"\nDCPD202500008Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Remarks on Presenting the Medal of HonorJanuary 3, 2025Please be seated. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, as the Commander in Chief, this is the most solemn occasion that I participated in in my 4 years every time we do this event.Secretary Austin, Secretary Wormuth, Chairman Brown\u2014General, it's good to see you\u2014 Representative Case, Castro, Ryan, and Takano, and, most importantly, veterans, servicemembers, and previous Medal of Honor recipients: Today is the final time as Commander in Chief and I'm deeply privileged to honor seven American\u2014seven American heroes. And that's not hyperbole. These are genuine to their core heroes.Heroes of different ranks, different positions, and even different generations. But heroes who all went above and beyond the call of duty. Heroes who all deserve our Nation's highest and oldest military recognition: the Medal of Honor.First Private Bruno Orig. A proud son of Hawaii, Bruno joined the Army when he was just 19 years old. Less than 1 year later, he was completing a mission in Korea. Bruno saw his fellow soldiers were wounded and stranded under enemy fire. Without hesitation, he ran out to rescue them, giving his own life to save the lives of his brothers-in-arms. That's valor. That's the definition of valor.Private First Class\u2014you know, I think it's incredible when I think of the men and women who have done\u2014who have gotten this award\u2014but Private First Class Wataru Nakamura. After an attack on Pearl Harbor, he was forced to live in an internment camp, like so many other Japanese Americans\u2014like my good friend Danny Inouye, who was a hero himself\u2014put in an internment camp.But still, he signed up to serve our Nation during World War II and the Korean War. During his last mission in May of 1951, single handedly, he defended his unit from enemy attack, fighting until he was killed by a grenade.Corporal Fred McGee. A Midwesterner, a steelworker, and a gunner in one of the first integrated Army units of the Korean War. Fred embodied the very best of our country. In June 1952, his unit was attacked. They took casualties. They were ordered to fall back. But Fred refused\u2014refused\u2014to leave until he helped every wounded soldier evacuate.Private First Class Charlie Johnson. Growing up, in the words of one of Charlie's high school classmate, \"He was a heck of a football player.\" Well, back in 1952, Charlie signed up to serve in Korea, trading his jersey for a uniform. During one battle, he gave his life to defend a bunker full of his wounded soldiers. His valor saved 10 men, including an old high school classmate.General Richard\u2014excuse me\u2014excuse me\u2014Cavazos. A young first lieutenant in Korea, Richard led his men through a difficult and deadly mission in enemy territory. Eventually, he was ordered to retreat, but he stayed. He stayed, rescuing wounded soldiers one by one until every one of them was evacuated. Richard went on to serve for three decades in the Army, becoming the first\u2014the country's first Hispanic four-star general.And Captain Hugh Nelson. A Citadel graduate, helicopter pilot, and a proud young father. He was just 28 years old when he and his crew were shot down in Vietnam. Hugh freed his men who were trapped in the wreckage. Then, as the enemy began to attack, he used his body as ashield to protect them. It cost him dearly. It cost him his life. Hugh's commanding officer called it the \"ultimate act of self-sacrifice,\" which it was.And finally, Private First Class Ken David, who is here with us today. Nearly 55 years ago, in Vietnam, his company was ambushed by the enemy. Ken's lieutenant was killed instantly.Then, Ken himself was hit in the back with shrapnel. But he couldn't and wouldn't give up. Instead, he shouted and fired his weapon the attacking\u2014to attract attention to him, away from others and away from the wounded men. Imagine that courage. \"Come get me. Come get me. Don't get those folks.\" That's selflessness.Ken, I want to say to you that I wish I could say to every man we're honoring today: You're a hero. A genuine hero. A flat-out, straight-up American hero. And we owe you and the families owe you.Let me close with this. I said\u2014as I said earlier, these are my final days as Commander in Chief. It's been the greatest honor of my life to be entrusted with the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. They're the finest military in the history of the world. And every day\u2014every day\u2014their integrity, their patriotism, and their courage.And to learn the stories of Americans like Bruno and Wataru and Fred and Charlie and Richard and Hugh, Ken: Americans who have not only fought for our Nation, but embodied the very best our Nation has to offer.Let me also say this. Today we award these individuals the Medal of Honor. But we can't stop there. Together, as a nation, it's up to us to give this medal meaning. To keep fighting\u2014to keep fighting\u2014for one another, for each other; to keep defending everything these heroes fought for and many of them died for: the ideals of America, the freedom we cherish, the democracy that has made our progress possible.And remember, we are the only nation in the world built on an idea. Every other nation is built based on geography, ethnicity, or religion. But we are the only nation based on an idea.The idea is that we hold these truths evident\u2014to be self-evident. All men and women are created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout their entire lives. We haven't always lived up to it, but we've never, ever, ever walked away from it.Today, we must say clearly: We never, ever, ever will.Now it's my great honor to ask Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Lichi\u2014excuse me\u2014Lichi the Medal of Honor\u2014to read the Medal of Honor citations.And thank you all for being here. And God bless you, and may God also protect our troops who are still engaged. Thank you.[At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Anthony J. Lichi, USN, Navy Aide to the President, read the citations, and the President presented the medals, assisted by Lt. Col. Azizi V.

Folks, I wanted you to come in because these eight men have done things that are changing not only their lives, but the lives of families that were able to celebrate Christmas\u2014I mean what they did. They saved children. They saved people in serious distress. They jumped into freezing water. They did it all.And I think it's\u2014I think it's very important that the public see them and know who they are. I know you have all their backgrounds, but what they did\u2014they allowed people to continue their lives in ways that they never would have been able to. There's a lot fewer empty chairs around the kitchen table and dining room table because of what these guys did.And what they did is amazing. They literally put their lives at risk, some of them at the point that you wonder how they could have had the nerve to do it.In addition to that, I want to thank their families, because if you're the spouse of a firefighter or a police officer, you always worry about that phone call\u2014that one phone call you're going to get when they know the alarm went off.

Please have a seat. Happy New Year.Audience members. Happy New Year!The President. And welcome to your house\u2014the White House, the \"people's house.\"You know, it's been said before the most important title in America is not \"President,\" but \"citizen.\" It's \"We the People.\" These are the words that are the rock upon which this Nation has been built. Not hyperbole.It's fitting that we gather here in the East Room next to the portrait of Teddy Roosevelt. A reformer, a soldier, a Governor, a President, he promoted the cause of active citizenship. Despite his rugged individualism, he believed in forging common ground.To paraphrase him, he once said, and I quote: \"Grave perils are yet to be encountered in the stormy course of the Republic. But there is no reason\u2014no reason\u2014we should fear them or doubt our capacity to overcome them if we each endeavor to live so as to deserve the high praise of being called a good American citizen.\"That's who you all are: good American citizens.That's the story of our Nation, carried forward by heart, hard work, and the American people.For those who were before our founding\u2014were here before our founding to those born generations later or who immigrated here seeking the blessings of America.It's the story of yet another great President we miss, I miss: Jimmy Carter. May we all strive to measure up to his highest standard of active citizenship in our time and to the highest standard set by women and men we celebrate here today.You know, for the final time as President, I have the privilege of bestowing the Presidential Citizens Medal, one of our Nation's highest honors, on an extraordinary\u2014and I mean extraordinary\u2014group of Americans.The Citizens Medal recognizes, quote, \"citizens of the United States of America who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country and to their fellow citizens.\"Over 50 years, Presidents of both parties have awarded this medal to Americans who've met that high calling\u2014diplomats and doctors, conservationalists [conservationists; White House correction], community organizers, philanthropists, faith leaders.You know, I've been honored to present law enforcement officers who defended our Capitol on January 6 and the State and local election officials and elected leaders who defended the free and fair election of nineteen\u2014of 2020.Today, we celebrate a new group of Americans who've dedicated their careers to serving our democracy in other\u2014in other\u2014essential ways. Some of you I've known and worked for a long time, none longer than Ted Kaufman. [Laughter] Others, I've admired your character from afar. You're all\u2014and I mean this sincerely\u2014you're all incredible\u2014incredible.You're activists who turned pain into purpose, forced open the doors of equality and justice. Attorneys who changed not just the laws, but society and brought America closer to our higheststated ideals. You are elected officials who have served in difficult times with honor, decency and ensure our democracy delivers. Storytellers who have shone light in darkness and educators\u2014 educators\u2014who have kindled new flames of imagination. You are veterans, veterans who have revolutionized trauma care, won recognition for women, and built new foundations for peace.Together, you embody\u2014and I mean this from the bottom of my heart\u2014the essential truth: We're a great nation\u2014we're a great nation\u2014because we're a good people\u2014a good people.And I've said it before: Our democracy begins and will be preserved in the habits of our heart, in our character, in our optimism that tested yet endures, in our courage that digs deep\u2014 real deep\u2014when we need it as a nation, in our empathy that fuels our common project of our willingness to see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans.I think it's pretty damn simple. Our democracy begins and ends with the duties of citizenship. That's our work for the ages, and it's what all of you\u2014and I mean this\u2014all of you embody.It's now my honor to award the Presidential Citizens Medal. We're going to ask the Military Aide to read each recipient's name as I welcome them to the stage and they receive their medal.Thank you for being here. And thank you to all the families, because all these awards that are being given today are in no small part because of all the support you gave them. Thank you, thank you.[At this point, Maj. Michael R. Jones, USMC, Marine Corps Aide to the President, read the citations, and the President presented the medals, assisted by Lt. Col. Rudy Bowen, USSF, Space Force Aide to the President. The President then spoke as follows.]The President. Can I say one more thing?Audience member. Yes. [Laughter]The President. We've got a lot of very important Senators in this room and friends of mine, including that guy right there. Stand up, Ed. Come on. Come on\u2014[inaudible]. Just stand up. No, I'm not\u2014then you stand up, man. [Laughter]And I want to\u2014you want to know who to blame because I'm President? Jim, stand up. [Laughter] South Carolina.All the Members of the House and the Senate, stand up.And the guy who\u2014who should be standing here, should\u2014should have been standing here, who is\u2014not only has a brave heart, but physically one of the bravest people I've ever known in my life, John Kerry. John, stand up.Look, I want to thank you all again and to your families for your service to the Nation.And by the way, it's not hyperbole to suggest that you, the families, have had such an incredible impact on all that they've done all that the country has done. We know it's not one single person that does it. No woman or man can go out and do the things they do without the support of their family.So thank you, thank you, thank you.And congratulations. Let's remember: Our work continues. We've got a lot more work to do.Keep this going.We have to\u2014as my\u2014every time I'd walk out of my Grandpop Finnegan's house\u2014Tommy's heard me say this a hundred times\u2014he'd yell, \"Joey, keep the faith.\" And my grandmother, \"No, Joey, spread it.\" [Laughter] Let's go spread the faith, okay?God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.

        "Content":"\nDCPD202500004Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Remarks on Federal Judicial NominationsJanuary 2, 2025The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. I'm sure you're clapping because I finally showed up. [Laughter]Terrorist Attack in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Vehicular Explosion in Las Vegas, NevadaI do apologize. We had a very busy schedule the last\u2014over\u2014from New Year's Day on, dealing with two crises\u2014one in Louisiana and one in Las Vegas. And I've assembled the entire defense and intelligence apparatus of the country in the Situation Room, and we've been spending a lot of time there. But I'm going to take another 2 minutes to talk a little bit about that and then go on to the\u2014what we're here for.I want to give an update on the investigations into yesterday's terrorist attacks in New Orleans and the truck explosion in Las Vegas. I've just come from the meeting\u2014not \"just,\" it's been\u2014while we've prepared these remarks\u2014better part of an hour\u2014from my homeland security team. The number of people killed in New Orleans has risen to 15, including the attacker. Thirty- five people were injured.Today the FBI briefed me that, as of now, no information\u2014we have no information that anyone else was involved in the attack. They've established that the attacker was the same person who planted the explosives in those ice coolers in two nearby locations in the French Quarter just a few hours before he rammed into the crowd with his vehicle.They assessed, he had a remote detonator in his vehicle to set off those two ice chests. So there's no question that\u2014remember all the talk about other people were involved, placed them? They have him\u2014they have established he's there and even established that he had a detonator to explode those ice chests.As I said yesterday, the attacker posted several videos just several hours before the attack, indicating his strong support for ISIS. Federal law enforcement and the intelligence community are actively investigating any foreign or domestic contacts or connections that could possibly be relevant to the attack.And so we're also continuing to investigate whether or not there's any connection between the New Orleans attack and the explosion in Las Vegas. As of now\u2014as of now\u2014I've just briefed, they have not found any evidence of such a connection thus far. I've directed them to keep looking.The individual who rented the truck to explode\u2014that exploded in Las Vegas also served as Active Duty U.S. Army. And the FBI is working with the Department of Defense on investigating, including the servicemember's possible motives and all those he worked with in\u2014 who served with him\u2014what things he'd say and do.I directed my team to accelerate these investigations so we have answers to our unanswered questions. And I'm making every single resource available to get the job done. And we're going to share the facts as soon as I learn them so the American public doesn't have to wonder.In the meantime, like I said last night, New Orleans is a city of tremendous spirit. It can't keep it down\u2014you really can't. And we are seeing that today. The Sugar Bowl is back on.Kickoff is going to take off very shortly. If I don't get this damn thing done, we're going to be inreal trouble. [Laughter] And the FBI is handing control to Bourbon Street back to local officials, security of the area has been reinforced, and it should be open for business later today. The\u2014 Bourbon Street.The people of New Orleans are sending an unmistakable message: They will not let this attack or the attacks\u2014attacker's\u2014his deluded ideology overcome us. None of us should fear it will\u2014he'll overcome us.And we're going to relentlessly pursue ISIS and other terrorist organizations where they are, and they'll find no safe harbor here.I'll continue to provide updates on New Orleans and Las Vegas as the facts develop.Federal Judicial NominationsNow to the business at hand. I can't tell you how much I appreciate these two men. Not a joke. You know, I want to\u2014the fact of the matter is that the\u2014Majority Leader Schumer and Chair Durbin, they\u2014their leadership has been invaluable.You know, from my days of leading the Senate Judiciary Committee 200 years ago\u2014 [laughter]\u2014I have made judicial nominations a priority. And some of you may remember, I was involved in some very contentious Supreme Court nominations over the years.And today I want to recognize a major milestone. The Senate recently confirmed its 235th Federal judge, which is the largest number of confirmations in a single Presidential term since the early eighties. That includes 1 Supreme Court Justice, 45 circuit court of appeal judges, 187 district court judges, and 2 judges on the Court of International Trade.And they represent the best of America. This is all about preserving the Constitution. I made two\u2014three speeches in this campaign\u2014in this\u2014my term as President. One when I first entered, saying democracy is at stake. One I later made at\u2014anyway. I made three major speeches. The institutions are in jeopardy, in my view. And some of the decisions coming down, to me, made no constitutional sense.They're all highly qualified people we've\u2014[inaudible]. They've had distinguished legal, judicial, and academic careers.It matters. Judges matter. You know, shaping the everyday lives of Americans. Protecting our basic freedoms. I never thought we'd be talking about this. Defending constitutional liberties. Replacing\u2014you know, respecting the idea precedent matters\u2014precedent matters.These judges will be independent, they'll be fair, and they'll be impartial, and they'll respect the rule of law. And most importantly\u2014I know this sounds\u2014I never thought I'd be saying this\u2014 they'd\u2014they'll uphold the Constitution. They'll uphold the Constitution.When I ran for President, I made a promise that I'd have a bench that looks like America that taps into the full talents of this Nation. And I'm proud we've kept our commitment, with the help of these two men and many others, bolstering confidence in judicial decisionmaking and outcomes.We have a record number of judges with backgrounds and experiences that have long been overlooked in the Federal judiciary, like advocates for civil rights, workers rights, immigrant rights, and so much more\u2014the first former public defender to sit in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.I've also continued to put forward men and women who have been prosecutors and plaintiff's attorneys, which has been a distant past in the\u2014of courts.No matter who they are or where they come from, all these appointees\u2014all these appointees\u2014understand the role of a judge and are committed to the rule of law, the institutional safeguards built on our Constitution, that upholds the rights and guarantees of the Constitution.You know, I have appointed the most demographically diverse slate of judicial nominees ever in the history of America that represents all of America and the best of America.There is numerous\u2014there is numerous historic firsts. The first Black woman on the United States Supreme Court. I made that promise, and we kept it. More Black women to the courts of appeals than every other previous administration in American history combined\u2014combined.Other historic firsts for Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, Muslim Americans. The list goes on. Look, the point is: For the first time in a long, long time, we have a bench that looks like and represents all of America. All of America.And a special thank you again to Leader Schumer and Chair Durbin for working tirelessly to move these nominees through the committee and onto the Senate floor in a very\u2014I think it's not an understatement to say\u2014a very contentious political period in American history. [Laughter] I\u2014 but think about it. One\u2014one-vote majority. I mean, it's amazing what they did.Other Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, worked with my administration to fill vacancies in their States.You know, all these Republican Senators, they were\u2014they weren't sending me Democratic nominees. They were sending me Republican nominees. But we got the\u2014sort of back to the basics, finding basic commitment to civil rights, civil liberties. Whether it was your counterpart in the leader of Republican party, in Kentucky, or wherever, we got people who are people who understand the institutional limitations and safeguards in the Constitution.I don't want to get anyone in trouble, but this includes some of my conservative friends in Indiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas. But they're\u2014also got appointed, and they're not Democrats, but they're\u2014understand the institutional structure of the court.Together, these judges are going to hear cases on issues ruling from everything as whether Americans can cast their ballot. I mean, literally, where they\u2014how they can cast their ballot, when it will be counted. Whether workers can unionize\u2014I thought we settled that in 1934\u2014and make a living wage for their families. Whether children can breathe clean air and drink clean water, and we mandate it by the Congress to do so.These judges also are a vital check on the excesses of other branches of Government, including Congress and the executive branch when they overreach and run afoul of the constitutional and institutional safeguards.So let me close with this. I'm proud\u2014proud\u2014of the legacy that we'll leave for our Nation as it relates to judges. And I'm proud of the men and women who stepped forward and heeded the call to serve. I really mean it.Think about it. If I looked at some of you and said, \"I want to nominate you.\" You said, \"In this time?\" [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Oh, I'm being\u2014I know this room is probably the only room that fully would understand and comprehend that.And, folks, I know\u2014I know they'll continue to uphold our Nation's founding principles of liberty, justice, equality, and do it for decades to come.As we say in my old neighborhood, it's a big deal. [Laughter] It's a big deal. And I\u2014bless me, Father, for I have sinned.[At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.][Laughter] But all kidding aside, I really\u2014I'm really proud of the caliber, capacity, willingness, and the academic backgrounds of all these men and women who we appointed. In fact, we appointed more women than others. That's just because I've\u2014was raised in a household where all the women are smarter than all the men. [Laughter]But all kidding aside, I really think we'll be proud of these women and men that have been appointed. And I think we're going to reestablish the safeguards that were built into the Constitution. Everybody, everybody, everybody has an equal opportunity. That's what it's all about.So thank you all and all the leaders in this room for all you've done. It wouldn't have gotten it done without you guys. Thanks for the recommendations and all the help. But most importantly, these two guys.The idea that if\u2014in the beginning, when we had that first conversation, Chuck said, \"We're going to appoint all these judges.\" We looked at each other like, \"Are we kidding ourselves?\" Right? [Laughter] Thank you, pal.Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer. Thank you, Mr. President.The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you.And, Dick\u2014by the way, I've ruined his reputation by bragging so much about him. I\u2014I was hesitant to do it during an election year because it might hurt him. But all kidding aside, every time we get in trouble, I literally ask my staff\u2014I say, \"Durbin is there.\" [Laughter] \"Durbin is there.\"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Richard J. Durbin. Thank you.The President. You're the best, pal.Sen. Durbin. Thank you.The President. You really are. Thank you. Thank you all so very much.NOTE: The President spoke at 3:34 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to MSgt.

The FBI is taking the lead in the investigation and is investigating this incident as an act of terrorism. I am grateful for the brave and swift response of local law enforcement in preventing even greater death and injury. I have directed my team to ensure every resource is available as Federal, State, and local law enforcement work assiduously to get to the bottom of what happened as quickly as possible and to ensure that there is no remaining threat of any kind.I will continue to receive updates throughout the day, and I will have more to say as we have further information to share. In the meantime, my heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply trying to celebrate the holiday. There is no justification for violence of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our Nation's communities.NOTE: The statement referred to Mayor LaToya Cantrell of New Orleans.Categories: Statements by the President : Terrorist attack in New Orleans, LA.Names: Cantrell, LaToya; Mayorkas, Alejandro N.; Monaco, Lisa O.; Sherwood-Randall, Elizabeth D.Subjects: Deputy Attorney General; Federal Bureau of Investigation; Homeland Security Adviser; Law enforcement officers, service and dedication; Louisiana, terrorist attack in New Orleans; Secretary of Homeland Security.DCPD Number: DCPD202500002.\n"

Well, good afternoon and happy New Year. Audience members. Happy New Year.The President. As we gather in this room on January 2025, imagine March of 1865.President Lincoln had just delivered his Inaugural Address at the Capitol. And he returned to the White House for a reception here in the East Room.There were many well wishers, but he spotted someone whose opinion he greatly valued.President Lincoln asked him what he thought of the speech he had just delivered to the Nation by a divided Civil War. The man replied, \"It was a sacred effort.\" \"It was a sacred effort.\" That man was Frederick Douglass.Here we are, nearly 160 years later, in the room where Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass stood to unify the Nation. I'm joined by our incredible First Lady, Jill. We're joined by incredible Vice President Kamala Harris, and Second Gentleman Doug. Doug is a hell of lawyer, by the way. [Laughter] Finally going to get to practice again, huh? [Laughter]And for the final time as President, I have the honor of bestowing the Medal of Freedom on\u2014our Nation's highest civilian honor on a group of extraordinary\u2014truly extraordinary people who gave their sacred effort\u2014their sacred effort to shape the culture and the cause of America.So let me just say to each of you, thank you, thank you, thank you for all you've done to help this country. You all\u2014you all literally embody the Nation's creed, \"E pluribus unum\"\u2014\"out of many, one.\"Collect in a [A collective of; White House correction] people of different backgrounds, beliefs, and talents, from the different generations and different genders, using their remarkable gifts and unwavering passion to strengthen our resolve as one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.It matters.

Together, you leave an incredible mark\u2014and I mean this sincerely\u2014this group up here\u2014you leave an incredible mark on our country, with insight and influence that can be felt around the globe, in major cities and remote areas alike, binding us closer as a people and showing us that\u2014what's possible as a nation\u2014there's nothing beyond our capacity\u2014while representing your families, your communities, your ancestors with pride and appreciation at the same time.I'd also like to take a moment to recognize those honorees who are no longer with us\u2014\u2014[At this point, a child in the audience spoke.]\u2014\u2014including the young man speaking.

And I'm grateful for the work you'll inspire for generations to follow to stay engaged, to never give up, to always keep the faith.And, in that spirit, from the \"people's house,\" where Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass and generation of patriots before us have stood watch over the Republic, I ask the Military Aide to begin the reading of the citations for this year's Medal of Freedom honorees.[Lt. Col. Rudy Bowen, USSF, Space Force Aide to the President, read the citations, and the President presented the medals, assisted by Lt. Col. Daniel K. DeRusha, USAF, Air Force Aide to the President. The President then resumed his remarks as follows.]Not a bad group, huh? [Laughter]Folks, thank you all again. Thank you and to your families for your service and theirs to the Nation.Congratulations. But let's remember: Our sacred effort continues. We have to keep going.

It's going to be a hell of a long way.The\u2014it's going to take time. But we're in it. The Federal Government is here to stay as long as you need us and everything you need.Is there anything you've asked that you haven't gotten yet?Governor Gavin C. Newsom of California. Quite the contrary. Mr. President, just, first of all, that major disaster declaration being approved\u2014next level appreciation on behalf of all the residents here in Southern California.As the chief said, we had prepositioned assets this weekend in anticipation of these weather events: the complexity of multiple fires; the likelihood these weather events\u2014this wind event would continue over the course of the next many days; impacts of over a thousand structures already that have been destroyed; a hundred-plus thousand people that have been evacuated; lives lost; traditions, lifestyles, places torn asunder. This means the world to us.And\u2014just publicly, because I think this is important: The President happened to be in the region, in town. It's impossible for me to express the level of appreciation and cooperation we received from the White House and this administration.So, on behalf of all of us, Mr. President, thank you for being here\u2014and not just being here today. Thank you for being here since the minute of this incident when it was a 10-acre fire less than 24-or-so hours ago. My deep gratitude.The President. It's astounding what's happened.There's only one piece of good news. My son lives out here and his wife. Their\u2014they got a notification yesterday that their home is probably burned to the ground. Today it appears that maybe it's still standing. We're not sure.But the good news is, I'm a great-grandfather as of today. My eldest granddaughter. A 10- pound, 4-ounce baby girl\u2014baby boy.So I'm going to remember this day for a lot of the wrong reasons. But anyway. [At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]Q.

The Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area includes waters within the United States Exclusive Economic Zone bounded to the north by the seaward boundary of the Bering Straits Native Corporation established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.); to the south by the southern boundaries of the Northern Bering Sea Research Area, the St. Matthew Habitat Conservation Area, and the Nunivak-Kuskokwim Habitat Conservation Area; and to the west by the maritime boundary delimited by the Agreement Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Maritime Boundary, signed at Washington, June 1, 1990.

        "Content":"\nDCPD202500027Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Statement on Efforts To Protect Oceans and Coasts From Offshore Oil and Gas DrillingJanuary 6, 2025I am taking action to protect the East and West coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and Alaska's Northern Bering Sea from oil and natural gas drilling and the harm it can cause. My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses, and beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our Nation's energy needs. It is not worth the risks. As the climate crisis continues to threaten communities across the country and we are transitioning to a clean energy economy, now is the time to protect these coasts for our children and grandchildren.From California to Florida, Republican and Democratic Governors, Members of Congress, and coastal communities alike have worked and called for greater protection of our ocean and coastlines from harms that offshore oil and natural gas drilling can bring. In Alaska, dozens of Tribes have fought to protect the Northern Bering Sea, a vital ocean ecosystem that supports their traditional ways of life. Vice President Harris and I have listened. In balancing the many uses and benefits of America's ocean, it is clear to me that the relatively minimal fossil fuel potential in the areas I am withdrawing do not justify the environmental, public health, and economic risks that would come from new leasing and drilling.The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, a man-made catastrophe that took the lives of eleven people and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, is a solemn reminder of the costs and risks of offshore drilling to the health and resilience of our coasts and fisheries and underscores the importance of the legal protections I am putting in place today. It is also one of the reasons why on my watch we have strengthened offshore safety standards for workers and communities on the front lines of existing operations nationwide, and rapidly accelerated the development of safer and cleaner energy sources, including the approval of eleven offshore wind projects.From day one, I have delivered on the most ambitious climate and conservation agenda in our country's history. And, over the last 4 years, I have conserved more than 670 million acres of America's lands and waters, more than any other President in history. Our country's remarkable conservation and restoration progress has been locally led by Tribes, farmers and ranchers, fishermen, small businesses, and outdoor recreation enthusiasts across the country. Together, our \"America the Beautiful\" initiative put the United States on track to meet my ambitious goal to conserve at least 30 percent of our Nation's lands and waters by 2030.We do not need to choose between protecting the environment and growing our economy or between keeping our ocean healthy, our coastlines resilient, and the food they produce secure and keeping energy prices low. Those are false choices. Protecting America's coasts and ocean is the right thing to do and will help communities and the economy to flourish for generations to come.Categories: Statements by the President : Oceans and coasts, protection efforts from offshore oil and gas drilling.Names: Harris, Kamala D.Subjects: Land and maritime conservation efforts; Oil and gas drilling, Federal oversight and regulation; Public and Tribal lands, conservation and management; Renewable energy sources and technologies; Vice President.DCPD Number: DCPD202500027.\n"

        "Date":"2025-01-05",
        "Content":"\nDCPD202500024Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Remarks on Signing the Social Security Fairness Act of 2023January 5, 2025The President. Thank you, thank you. Thank you very much, Bette. Thank you.I know in about 20 years, I'll become a senior. [Laughter] It's hell turning 40, you know? [Laughter]God bless you all.Bette, thanks for that introduction and for all the work you've done for retired Americans. It makes a gigantic difference. Thank you, thank you, thank you.And by the way, if you excuse what they in the Senate\u2014they used to say in the Senate, \"a point of personal privilege.\" She gave me a handwritten poem from her husband who wrote to me, saying I look like I'm 20. [Laughter] So thank him very well. I'll give him a call. Thank you.And thank you to the current and former Members of Congress for being here today, particularly Susan Collins. Susan, I hope it doesn't hurt your reputation, my complimenting you. [Laughter] Sherrod Brown. Get up, Sherrod. Stand. And Abigail Spanberger. Where's Abigail? Get up, Abigail.I also want to thank Leader Schumer and Representative Garret Graves. Schumer is not here, is he?Audience member. No.The President. All right. And Garret couldn't make it today either.But all of you have kept this bipartisan bill on track from the beginning to end. And so did our great labor leaders here today. I want to thank them.You know, my dad taught me\u2014and I mean this\u2014my friends are tired of hearing me saying this: \"A job is a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,'\"\u2014and know there's a real prospect that that's going to happen.The bill I'm signing today is about a simple proposition. Americans who have worked hard all their lives to earn an honest living should be able to retire with economic security and dignity. That's the entire purpose of the Social Security system crafted by Franklin Delano Roosevelt nearly 90 years ago.Social Security is the bedrock of financial security for retirees and survivors and for millions of Americans with disabilities. But we've all heard the stories like the one that Bette shared today. Public-sector employees, teachers, nurses, maintenance workers, and more\u2014many working second jobs beyond their public service, often just because they need it to make ends meet.The law that existed denied millions of Americans access to the full Social Security benefits they earned by thousands of dollars a year. That denial of benefits also applied to surviving spouses of public-service employees. Benefits cut that cost them security and a little bit of dignity as well.Joining us today, Eliseo, a 17-year-old from Texas. Where is Eliseo?Audience member. He's right here.The President. Come here.Eliseo\u2014Eliseo is just around the corner from receiving Social Security. [Laughter]This guy walked 1,600 miles from Washington\u2014from here to\u2014from Texas to Washington, DC, to support this bill. And he did it\u2014he did it for his grandmother, a retired teacher who struggled to survive without the Social Security benefits she earned, and he thought it wasn't right.But guess what? Tomorrow is his birthday. We have a tradition in our household. We've got to sing \"Happy Birthday.\" You ready?[At this point, the President led the audience in singing \"Happy Birthday\" to Lubbock, TX, resident Eliseo Jimenez.]All right. Eliseo, I and others here have one request.Mr. Jimenez. Yes.The President. When you're President\u2014[laughter]\u2014and they say, \"Joe Biden is in the outer office,\" promise me you won't say, \"Joe who?\" [Laughter]Thank you, pal. You did a good job; your mom\u2014grandmom would be proud.Mr. Jimenez. Thank you. Thank you.The President. Thank you. Go ahead.Look, by signing this bill we're extending Social Security benefits for millions of teachers, nurses, and other public and\u2014employees and their spouses and survivors. That means an estimated average of $360 per month increase. That's a big deal in middle class households like the one I grew up in and many of you did\u2014and million\u2014for millions of Americans going forward.That's not all. Over 2\u00bd million Americans are going to receive a lump-sum payment of thousands of dollars to make up for the shortfall in the benefits they should have gotten in 2024. It's going to be a big deal.They're going to begin receiving these payments this year. And this is a big deal. Someone once said, \"This is a big deal.\" It's a big deal. [Laughter]As\u2014[laughter]\u2014as the first President in more than 20 years to expand Social Security benefits, this victory is the culmination of a 48\u2014a 4-year\u2014excuse me, 4-year [40-year; White House correction] fight to provide security for workers who dedicated their lives to their communities. And I'm proud\u2014I'm proud to have played a small part in this fight and get to sign it.And thanks to Sherrod Brown and Richie Neal\u2014Richie\u2014and other advocates in this room, one of the first things we did was to protect pensions for as many as 2 million union workers and retirees when we signed the Butch Lewis Act. It's the most significant action to protect union pensions in 50 years. And the Butch Lewis Act helped them in\u2014helped them retire with dignity.Look, just like the Social Security Fairness Act, when I'm sign\u2014about to sign\u2014what I'm signing today\u2014when I came to office, I promised I'd always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. I never thought anybody would have to make that promise to protect it, but we had to make that promise. We still do.I said repeatedly that if anyone tried to cut these programs, I'd stop them. And that's the promise we've kept, even in the face of proposals to cut and weaken these programs that millions of Americans count on.I know there's a lot more work to do, by the way, to improve and expand benefits, including those who most are in need, to protect Social Security for the long term, and finally asking the wealthiest Americans to begin to pay their fair share so it's able to be maintained, and so much more.Folks, we could not have done this alone. To the people in this room and the people around the country who did the work, who kept the faith, thank you, thank you, thank you.Our economy today is the strongest economy in the world. We've got more to do, but it's the strongest economy in the world because we have the best workers in the world. We have the best workers in the\u2014[applause]\u2014we do.And I might add, parenthetically, when I asked the\u2014I went to South Korea to get the communications\u2014excuse\u2014to get Samsung to send back the chipmakers to the United States. We invented the damn things. [Laughter] We used to have 40 percent of the market.And he said, \"Yes.\" And I finally said\u2014I said, \"Why?\" This is the God's truth. The foreign leader of a major corporation said, \"Because you have the best, most qualified workers in the world\u2014union worker\"\u2014no, I'm serious\u2014\"and because it's the safest place in the world to invest.\"Look, let me close with this. Today is a victory for the dignity of work and the dignity of workers, everyday people who build the middle class, who built this country. We must never forget it. We can't forget who did it.We just have to remember who we are. For God's sake, we're the United States of America.The United States\u2014there's nothing beyond our capacity if we set our mind to it and we do it together.So God bless you all. May God protect our troops. And now let's sign this bill. [The President greeted participants at the signing desk.]The President. All right. Who\u2014we've got spots up here. Come on.Senator Susan M. Collins. We do. This is so exciting.Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra. Well done, Mr. President.The President. Well, thank you.Everybody knows that I like her so much, I'd hurt her reputation. [Laughter] Okay. You ready? Get set. Go. [Laughter][The President signed the bill.] All right.Secretary Becerra. Bette. Bette.[The President handed a pen to Elizabeth \"Bette\" Marafino, president of the Connecticut Alliance for Retired Americans.]The President. Here you go, Bette. Thank you, thank you, thank you.All right. I know it's going to be a long time for any of you to collect Social Security, like me, but it's\u2014let's get going. [Laughter]Thank you, thank you, thank you, everybody. This is a good day.NOTE: The President spoke at 4:31 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to former Sen.

The same can be said of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.When I became President, he was the first foreign leader I spoke with. I spoke to him yesterday and expressed my appreciation for his partnership over the years.

We've stood together with the people of Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression to defend our nations' most sacred value: freedom. And we have made generational investments to strengthen our supply chains and rebuild our economies from the bottom up and middle out, establishing North America as the most economically competitive region in the world.Over the last decade, Prime Minister Trudeau has led with commitment, optimism, and strategic vision.

Biden, Jr., 2025Remarks at an Interfaith Prayer Service for Peace and Healing in New Orleans, LouisianaJanuary 6, 2025Your Excellency, Archbishop Aymond; members of the clergy representing Christian, Jewish, Muslim faiths across the board, thank you for what you're doing.Governor Landry, Representatives Carter and Fields, Mayor Cantrell, and all elected officials and members of the community.Most of all, the families and loved ones of those we lost in this horrific act of terrorism last Wednesday.I know events like this are hard when the shock and pain is still so very raw. My wife Jill and I are here to stand with you, to grieve with you, to pray with you, and let you know you are not alone. The rest of the Nation is looking at you as well.It's not the same, but we know what it's like to lose a piece of our soul: the anger, the emptiness, the black hole that seems to be sucking you into your chest, the sense of loss, the questions of faith in your soul.I know it's been 5 days staring at that empty chair in the kitchen, around the kitchen table, and not hearing the voice. You think of the birthdays, the anniversaries, the holidays to come without them. You think of everything\u2014everyday things, the small things, the details you'll miss the most. The morning coffee you shared together. The bend of his smile. The perfect pitch of her laugh.The rest of America has learned about them as well. Students who dreamed of becoming engineers or nurses. Star athletes who worked on Wall Street or helped coach small children. Warehouse managers. Bluegrass fan. Cook, engaged to be married. A single mom just promoted at work and teaching her young son to read.They came from different States, even different country. They were children who had dinner with their parents be sure\u2014before joining their friends on New Year's Eve. Some even ran toward the chaos to try to help save others. We remember them.Today we also stand with the 35 people who were injured in the attack, and we think of the brave responders and law enforcement officers\u2014officials who risked their lives to stop the terror and save others, including two of those officers that I met tonight, injured in the firefight. Now, thankfully, both are recovering and are home.I've directed my team to make every resource available to Federal, State, and local law enforcement to complete this investigation quickly and do whatever else we can.The French Quarter is also home to so many people. We will support everyone who lives there, all the people of New Orleans as they heal.And if there's one thing we know, New Orleans defines strength and resilience. You define it. Whether it's in the form of this attack\u2014from this attack or hurricanes or superstorms, this city and its people get back up.That's the spirit of America as well.Let me close with this. To the families left behind, we know from some experience it's hard. But I promise you, the day will come when the memory of your loved one\u2014you pass that park,open that closet door, smell that fragrance, just remember that laugh\u2014when the memory of your loved one will bring a smile to your lips before a tear to your eye.It will take time, but I promise you\u2014I promise you, it will come. It will take time. My prayer is that that day comes sooner rather than later. But it will come. And when it does, you my\u2014may you find purpose in your pain to live the life worthy of the one you lost.From the hymn based on the 91st Psalm in my church, \"May He raise you up on eagle's wings and bear you on the breath of dawn, make you to shine like the sun, and hold you\u2014hold you\u2014in the palm of His hand.\"God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. God bless you.NOTE: The President spoke at 6:51 p.m. at the Cathedral-Basilica of St. Louis King of France. In his remarks, he referred to Ofc. Jacobi Jordan and Ofc.

Well, welcome to your house.Audience members. Aww.The President. We're honored to have you here. Look, we host you, the newest Members of Congress. It brings back a lot of memories. Congratulations to you and your families.And thank you all for\u2014the steering and policy chair, Amy Klobuchar, who, if I were you\u2014\u2014I'd listen to everything she says, everything she does. [Laughter] House Democratic Caucus chair is here, but before that, we're going to have Gary Peters announced.Gary, where are you? There he is. And Pete Aguilar is here as well. Pete.Well, you made it through the campaign, and now your work begins to deliver for your people. And we've been in your shoes\u2014the excitement, the expectations, and the little bit of nervousness occasionally. It's okay.My advice to you is to embrace the institution you serve. I really mean it. Improve it. Don't tear it down.You know, we\u201436 years ago, I loved\u2014for 36 years, I was a United States Senator. I got elected when I was 29. You have to be 30 to be sworn in, and I wasn't old enough to be sworn in. And I came down to Washington, and I\u2014when I was in\u2014a guy\u2014a number of the senior Senators helped me out. And I was in Teddy Kennedy's office, waiting to\u2014hiring staff, interviewing people, and I got a phone call in his office that my wife and daughter had just been killed, and my two boys weren't likely to live. They had been struck by a tractor trailer, broadsided them on\u2014 Christmas shopping.And the reason I bother to tell you this story is not to seek any sympathy, but to say to you that my decision at that time was to not be sworn in, to get the hell out. And we had a Democratic Governor, so I knew they were going to be able to appoint a Democratic Senator, and that wasn't a worry.And\u2014but a group of about seven Democrats and Republican Senators, starting with Mike Mansfield, who they called \"Iron Mike,\" who was a\u2014the Majority Leader\u2014and a Southerner named Fritz Hollings. And a bunch of folks got together, and they came to see me in two different groups to convince me to stay because I knew that\u2014that they'd get\u2014we'd get another Senator, but I wasn't sure\u2014I didn't think they'd get another father, my two boys who were recovering. And so I wasn't going to stay.But they brought me into their homes, these Senators. There were six, seven of them. I won't name all\u2014bore you with it. But from Teddy Kennedy to Fritz Hollings to Mike Mansfield, and they just embraced me. They\u2014and they didn't\u2014it wasn't overly sympathetic. It was just, you know, \"You just come and stay\"\u2014I'll never forget. \"Just come and stay 6 months; then you can go home.\" [Laughter] Then you can go home.\"But what they did was they pulled me in. They pulled me in. They invited me to their homes. There\u2014there used to be, back in those days, Democrats and Republicans were\u2014had friendships,and they would still have dinners at each other's homes, private dinners and the like. And all of a sudden, I got included. I got pulled in.And Mike Mansfield, who was the leader of the Senate\u2014they called him \"Iron Mike\"\u2014from Montana, he has more integrity in his little finger than most people had in their whole body. And I used to have to report this office every day\u2014every Tuesday at 2 o'clock. I thought everybody reported\u2014he'd give me an assignment. I thought everybody got an assignment. Nobody gets an assignment\u2014[laughter]\u2014in the Senate.But it just basically, looking back on it, to take my pulse to see how I was doing. Because every time, as soon as the Senate was out, I'd literally jog down to the\u2014Penn Station [Union Station; White House correction] to get on the train to go home because I commuted every day.Anyway, to make a long story short, there's a purpose to my telling you this. I was 100 in seniority and\u2014of the United States Senate, and they still cared for me. They looked out for me. And they gave me strength, and I stay engaged. They didn't\u2014I\u2014they didn't stay\u2014I didn't stay engaged; I got really engaged. I was here for 50 years. [Laughter][At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.][Laughter] But my point is, you don't have to give up your principles or your beliefs to build relationships, to compromise and reach a consensus. That's often the only way to get big things done, at least in my experience. That's what I've tried to do my whole career.And I'm proud of the record we're going to leave you all to build on: an economy that grows from the middle out and the bottom up instead of the top down; the once-in-a-generation investment in infrastructure\u2014over a billion two hundred million dollars and\u2014a trillion two hundred billion dollars; the CHIPS and Science Act; the climate change; clean energy.The point is that\u2014[applause]. The point is, whether it's reducing prescription drug costs or reducing gun violence or reasserting America's leadership in the world and, maybe most important of all, standing up for democracy.And every generation gets tested. I taught constitutional law for a long time, and I used to always give a lecture about every generation has to fight for\u2014I never really believed what I was saying\u2014[laughter]\u2014in the sense that I didn't think I'd have to fight to maintain democracy.But tomorrow is January 6. Tomorrow is January 6. We gather to certify the results on a free and fair Presidential election and ensure a peaceful transfer of power. It's a day that, most of our history, we took for granted, the 6th, but I hope we never take it for granted again.You know, 4 years ago, January 6, this Capitol was attacked by a violent mob. If you can come over to the Oval before I leave, I'll show you the room that the former President sat in for 3\u00bd hours, watching what was going on on television in the small dining room off of my\u2014off of the Oval Office. And our democracy was really, literally, put to the test. And thankfully, our democracy held.But the big reason is because of the bravery of the Capitol Police and the local people who stood with us. Never forget them. They're guarding you. Give them the respect and support they deserve.But it's also due to the Members of the House and the Senate, who, even in the face of these threats\u2014you know, those threats to their life\u2014courageously fulfilled their duty to the Constitution. They showed up and did the work.Now it's your duty to tell the truth, to remember what happened, and not let January 6 be rewritten as a\u2014or even erased; to honor the Constitution not only on the most extraordinary ofdays, but\u2014it's one of the toughest days in American history, January 6\u2014but every day. You know, you've sworn an oath, and I know you'll never forget the oath you swore to.But now, 4 years later, I'm leaving the office of the President. I'm determined to do everything in my power to respect the peaceful transfer of power.You know, I don't think a\u2014[applause]. I wasn't going to run when I ran in 2020 because I had lost my son, didn't want any part of getting engaged again. But my son Beau and\u2014who was the attorney general and likely the Governor\u2014next Governor of the State of Delaware.But you know, I think it's important to restore basic conditions. The last time this occurred, this transfer of power, the losing party never even showed up\u2014never even showed up for the\u2014 for any\u2014for\u2014and everybody, understandably, says to me: \"Why are you being nice, Joe? Why'd you have him over to the office for 2 hours? Why are you cooperating?\" Because we've got to\u2014 the rules matter. The institutions matter. The safeguards matter. They really matter.And look, you know, the core traditions we've long respected in America, certifying an election is\u2014attending an Inauguration of an incoming President\u2014and this is all part of the tradition we have to begin to restore. And I hope you, too, will work to restore the traditions to keep this country stronger.Let me\u2014you know, we can never forget democracy\u2014everything is possible. Everything is possible\u2014our freedoms, our rights, our liberties, our dreams. And the work of our democracy falls to every generation of Americans to earn it.I know\u2014I used to teach\u2014I used to say that, \"earn it.\" And I never really\u2014I taught it, and I knew it was true, but I never felt it. I never believed it. But we have to defend it and protect it because it's always under siege.And look, we're going through a really\u2014I know a lot of my colleagues are tired of hearing me saying this, but we're going through a period in American history which is one of those inflection points in history. The cold war is over. The cold war era is over. We're in an entirely new era. Everything has changed, not because of any single woman or man. Because the nature of things that have changed.Think of the transitions that are taking place in the world, unrelated to who the leadership is.Think of what's going on, whether it's global warming or whether it's the idea that the whole alliances are breaking down and being reestablished. And it seems to me that our safety depends\u2014and security depends\u2014in large part, on who our partners are, who our allies are. They matter.So, you're going to be in a position to have to deal with\u2014I\u2014one of the things I'm proudest of is I rebuilt NATO. I say \"I,\" but I did. For real. [Laughter] I mean, it took\u2014by the way, I spent over\u2014no, no, no. No, I\u2014[inaudible]\u2014said that\u2014it took me over a\u2014we calculated it\u2014120 hours with these world leaders individually\u2014speaking to them individually on why it was important.I remember getting a phone call 10 days before he died from Dr. Kissinger, saying, \"Joe\"\u2014I was, half the time, in a different position than Kissinger was because I was a senior Senator at the time during the Vietnam war by that time. And he said, \"Not since Napoleon has Europe not looked over their shoulder with dread at was going on in Moscow until you came\u2014you guys came\"\u2014he said \"you,\" but it was about me\u2014\"you came along.\" We've improved NATO. We strengthened it. We put it back together again. We put it back together again.We're in a position where we were able to convince\u2014did you ever think we'd be in a position\u2014those of you who are students of history\u2014where Japan would be spending 2 percent of its GDP on defense? We'd get 50 nations to support us\u2014our efforts in Ukraine? Why? Becausethe world's gotten so damn small\u2014so damn small. They all understand: What happens in my neighborhood is going to affect every neighborhood.We're putting together alliances in the South Pacific, in the Indian Ocean, the Quad. Did anybody ever think we'd get India, Japan, Australia, and the United States in one organization?The point I'm making is, everything is changing.I've known\u2014I've known Putin for over 47 years. Met with him many times. I remember when I met with him in off\u2014in the off period between the time that we were elected and before we were sworn in\u2014or just after we were sworn\u2014no, actually, before we\u2014no, that's true\u2014just after we sworn in, in early February. And I wanted to talk about reestablishing arms control and dealing with nuclear weapons.And he started to talk about how Russia had changed and so on and so forth. And he talked about he\u2014his\u2014he has eight time zones. I said: \"Yes, eight time zones along the\u2014around the\u2014 Arctic Circle. And guess what? The ice is melting, and what's coming out is not greenhouse gasses. It's methane. You're never going to control it. It's not going to refreeze. What are you going to do about it?\"So my point is, so much is changing, and we have\u2014and think about this: You know, if we don't lead the world, who leads? And that's not a criticism of any of our allies, but who has the capacity to try to hold the world together? Not a joke. We can do it without going to war. We can do it\u2014as we've been able to do, God willing\u2014\u2014[The President knocked on wood.]\u2014\u2014since we've become\u2014come into office. We can do it without sending American forces to places.So I guess what I'm trying to say to you is\u2014you know, let me close with what I call the Senate point of personal privilege. [Laughter] You know, my father used to say, \"It's a lucky person that wakes up, put both feet in the ground, and believes that what he or she does matters.\" Well, you're among the lucky few. What you do really is going to matter economically and politically.But one piece of unsolicited advice, and I was reluctant to say this with the press here, but I'm going to do it anyway, because they\u2014because they\u2014they can know the facts here. Going back to when I told you, when I got elected, I didn't want to stay. Teddy Kennedy and Fritz Hollings and Tom Eagleton and a number of Republicans as well\u2014there were nine of them\u2014 decided to, you know, keep me engaged and invite me to everything they were doing. And Teddy used to come over my office and say, \"Let's go to lunch.\" And I wanted no part of going to lunch or getting to know anybody. I didn't want to\u2014I just wanted to do my job, get\u2014get down on Union Station, and go home. I mean, for real. You\u2014and many of you have been through what I've been through and a lot worse.And so one day he walks over, and he says\u2014I won't use his exact language. He says, \"Darn it, Joe, you're going lunch with me.\" So I went over to the private Senate dining room. There's two Senate dining rooms. The one dining room where you take\u2014you'll be able to take someone if you're a Senator, and the House is not fundamentally different.But, in the Senate, there was\u2014I was fairly successful at bringing together coalitions as a Senator. I don't mean it like\u2014I mean, but I worked like hell, and it\u2014and I\u2014Barack used to always kid me. We'd meet every morning. The first thing, we'd meet with one another at 9 in the morning every morning, and the last person we'd each speak to at night when we ended the day was with one another. That's the deal we made. And one of the things was, he always used to saythat\u2014you know, I know and I'd always be\u2014I said: \"Look, Barack, all politics is personal. All politics is personal.\"And the reason I mention that is that I went over\u2014Teddy had me come over to the Senate. There used to be a Senate dining room. When you walk in the first floor on the Senate side, you go down that hall on the first cross corridor where the\u2014by the elevators. One goes into the foreign relations executive committee room; another goes down to the staircase going up to the floor, as well as an elevator; and then there's an office door on the left and one on the right. On the right is the Senate dining room.Those of you who are Senators are going to be able to bring any of your colleagues or friends in to have lunch with you. But the door on the left used to be a private Senate dining room. You had to be\u2014only a U.S. Senator was allowed in. And you walked in, and it was a T- shaped. You walked in, and there was a buffet table on the left, which had all the luncheon material out, and a long table on the right, like a big dining room table, but it was\u2014seated, I'm guessing, 18 to 20 people. And then you walk straight ahead, and perpendicular was another table by windows looking out over the parking lot, and there was another table that held 20 or so people, and that was the Democratic table.And so what would happen\u2014Teddy brought me in, and he said, \"All I want you to do is just\"\u2014and you know this to be the case\u2014\"just walk in, just sit and listen. You'll learn more in an hour sitting here with these senior Senators and others than you'll learn in the next 10 hours doing anything else.\"So I remember sitting down. And Jim Eastland\u2014I ran because of civil rights in my State. We were segregated by law, to our great shame. And here is Jim Eastland and, you know, John Stennis and Herman Talmadge and all these guys\u2014these Southern, by any definition, racist Senators. And I sat there and listened. Teddy and Eastland would go at it hammer and tong up on the floor. They'd go down and eat together. They didn't leave their values behind, their points of view, but they sat and ate with one another.And so what happens when you get to know that the other Senator\u2014he is\u2014her husband has testicular cancer and is dying? Well, you have a different perspective. When you find out that one of them has a son that they\u2014that has a serious learning disability or somebody has just lost their mother or father, you learn about what they're going through, and it personalizes things in a way that only private conversation and personal things can do.And you begin to understand, and you begin to learn about\u2014and you'll find this; you already know this in your States as Congresspersons in districts\u2014that the next district over, the person may not be a bad guy or woman, but they have a constituency of a very different view than yours does\u2014not bad or good, different than yours does. Not a whole lot of people in Kansas worry about fishing rights in the Atlantic. [Laughter] Not a whole lot of people in, you know, on the Atlantic coast are worried about agricultural issues on corn in Nebraska.I mean, so you begin to look at other people's perspectives, and it becomes less personal\u2014it becomes less personal. It's not \"you're a bad person.\"The end result of it all is, we lost that. And so, as I think some of my senior colleagues in this room can tell you, you know, I was Vice President for 8 years. I think it was the sixth or seventh year, things had really gone to hell in the way we were dealing with each other on the floor, the leadership. And everybody wondered how in the hell I could get along with the Senator from Kentucky. He never once\u2014[inaudible]\u2014he never once lied to me, whatever he said he did, and I understood his circumstance he was in.But here's the deal. I realized that every time there was something going on in the Senate\u2014I think he'd tell you, the main reason Barack picked me to be Vice President was my background in American foreign policy, because I had done so much of it, and because of my relationships in the Senate and the Congress. I was\u2014I loved the Senate. I consider myself a Senate man more than I do a President\u2014for real\u2014after 36 years.And so I realized there were a lot of new Senators I didn't know, I didn't have a personal relationship with, and realized what it\u2014how difficult that was for me to figure out their thinking, why they were doing what they were doing, why\u2014and what could I do to answer their concerns without violating any principles that they had.And so I decided to go over to the Senate dining room. And I walked in the door. There's nothing there. There's lounge chairs. There was no place\u2014and I don't\u2014not sure about the House\u2014there's no place in the United States Senate where a group of Senators can say, \"Let's go have lunch together, all together.\" It doesn't exist.It's a gigantic loss\u2014a gigantic loss. When we'd do on CODELs, we used to take our spouses with us. It matters. It matters, when you know one spouse is having great difficulty because their husband isn't being in the position where they're home on time because they're taking too much time what they're doing in their job or whatever it is.And when you get to\u2014think about your personal relationships. The people you grew up with, you have different points of view on. The people you, in fact, know, you worked with, who have different perspectives in life, much of it's because of their present\u2014their circumstance. And when you know it, you can almost always figure a way through it.We don't do that anymore. And I'm not saying this for the first time, but the single greatest loss we have is, we don't know each other anymore. We don't know each other like we used to know each other. I'm serious. Not a joke.And so I really urge you\u2014presumptuous of me to say this\u2014if you're a good politician, you're good at interfacing with people. You can get people to trust you, looking at you, and knowing what you're saying to them is true. Your word is your bond. You break it once, man, in the Senate or the House, goodbye Charlie. I'm not joking.It's fundamentally, fundamentally different. But if you say: \"I've got to do this because this\u2014my constituency, this is important to them. I know it's not to your\"\u2014forget it.The end result of all this is, in my career, I have been asked to do the eulogy of the most incredibly different people: Strom Thurmond, hundred years old, on his deathbed, I get a phone call from the\u2014from the hospital, from out of Walter Reed. And it's his wife, Nancy, saying: \"Joe, I'm here with the doctors at the nurses station. Strom asked me to ask you whether or not you would do his eulogy.\"And I said, \"Well, Nancy\"\u2014\"No, Joe, it's important to him. Would you do his eulogy?\"Well, you know, people change. I'm not making them rewrite Strom Thurmond. He was a segregationist. But when Strom Thurmond got elected to the United States Senate, the second time around, the New York Times had a big headline in nineteen\u2014I can't remember the year now\u2014\"Strom Thurmond, Hope of the South,\" because Strom Thurmond decided that \"separate, but equal\" is not right\u2014not that Blacks and Whites should be together, but if you do separate but equal, you had to spend as much money on Black schools as White schools.By the time Strom Thurmond left the United States Senate, he had\u2014I'm not making a case for him, but he had more African Americans on his staff than any United States Senator had\u2014 more. Strom Thurmond had an illegitimate child with a Black woman. Never denied it and never stopped paying for her\u2014his upbringing.There's a lot of strange people, a lot of different people. No, I mean\u2014well, I'll bet I could look at you, and I could find some strange things too. [Laughter] No, but I'm really serious. Think about it. Think about it.And so, when you sit down with people\u2014I mean, the idea that I got Jesse Helms to vote to fund the United Nations. [Laughter] I'm serious. Went to Jesse Helms's eulogy\u2014I mean, Jesse Helms's funeral. You know what Jesse Helms talked about? Before he died, he said: \"I made a big mistake, Joe. I should have never said what I said.\"And by the\u2014I didn't get on with him at all. But you know what he said? He said, \"I should have never said what I said about, you know, all those folks just got out of trees not long ago, like monkeys.\" He said: \"I was wrong about that. I want to take it all back.\"People can change. But you've got to know that\u2014you've got to talk to them. Doesn't mean you can do it. But things can change.And, folks, we can't go through another 4, 8, 12 years what we did in the last previous 4 years. We can't do it.And a lot of you have a lot of experience in foreign policy. The rest of the world looks to us.They look to us. We're the only organizational capacity of any nation in the world to pull these things together.Who else will do it? They're good people\u2014the Brits, the French, the Germans, a whole range of people. But do you think any of them can do it? They're looking to us.We can do it without sending troops. We can do it without a war. We can do it without a whole\u2014all the things that are the downsides. And I think with your help and a lot of people\u2014the help of the leadership here, we've done a pretty damn good job so far of putting things back on track.So please don't listen to those who say, \"Don't talk.\" You're smarter than most of these people are. You know what you want to do. [Laughter]Well, I'm serious. Think about it. How many people get here just purely based on prejudice, just purely based on the kinds of things that are just lies?But people change. And so I know I drove Barack crazy when I'd say, I know, I know, I know\u2014politics is all personal. But think about it.How in God's name do you think I got Yoon and the Prime Minister of Japan, after World War II, never speaking to one another and hating each other because of what happened to the women, to sit down and sign a treaty together at Camp David? How did that happen? What changed? Not their publics, but they realized what they had at stake, and they decided to move something.So my point is, I've looked at all your\u2014I should\u2014shouldn't say this, but I did. I looked at all your backgrounds. [Laughter] You're smart as hell. You're incredibly, incredibly qualified.So please reach out. I don't want you to compromise on any principle you fully disagree with, but just understand the other person's perspective. It's a way to get to go. Because if we don't do that, look at\u2014anyway, I'm confident you're going to be able to change this, turn this around, in a way that we continue down the road we're on.Audience member. Yes!And so thank you, thank you, thank you. And God bless you all.Audience member. God bless you, Joe.The President. And keep it personal. Thank you.[The President left the podium and greeted attendees. He then spoke briefly as follows.]Can you turn that down? We've got a tradition in our family.

        "Title":"Eulogy at a Memorial Service for Former President Jimmy Carter",
        "Date":"2025-01-09",
        "Content":"\nDCPD202500041Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Eulogy at a Memorial Service for Former President Jimmy CarterJanuary 9, 2025Leaders of the clergy; distinguished guests; most importantly, the Carter family:In April 2021, Jill and I visited Jimmy and Rosalynn on a warm spring day down in Plains, Georgia. We wanted to see them.Rosalynn met us at the front door with her signature smile. Together, we entered a home that they had shared for almost 77 years of marriage, an unassuming red-brick ranch home that reflects their modesty more than any trappings of power.We walked in the living room, where Jimmy greeted us like family. That day, just the four of us sat in the living room and shared memories that spanned almost six decades. A deep friendship that started in 1974.I was a 31-year-old Senator, and I was the first Senator outside of Georgia\u2014I\u2014maybe the first Senator\u2014to endorse his candidacy for President. It was an endorsement based on what I believe is Jimmy Carter's enduring attribute: character. Character. Character.Because of that\u2014character, I believe, is destiny\u2014destiny in our lives and, quite frankly, destiny in the life of the Nation. It's an accumulation of a million things built on character that leads to a good life and a decent country: a life of purpose, a life of meaning.Now, how do we find that good life? What does it look like? What does it take to build character? Do the ends justify the means?Jimmy Carter's friendship taught me\u2014and, through his life, taught me that strength of character is more than title or the power we hold. It's the strength to understand that everyone should be treated with dignity, respect; that everyone\u2014and I mean everyone\u2014deserves an even shot, not a guarantee, but just a shot.You know, we have an obligation to give hate no safe harbor and to stand up to what my dad used to say is the greatest sin of all: the abuse of power.And that's not about being perfect because none of us are perfect. We're all fallible. But it's about asking ourselves: Are we striving to do things\u2014the right things? What values\u2014what are the values that animate our spirit? Do we operate from fear or hope, ego or generosity? Do we show grace? Do we keep the faith when it's most tested?For keeping the faith with the best of humankind and the best of America is a story, in my view, from my perspective, of Jimmy Carter's life. A story of a man\u2014to state the obvious, you've heard today some great, great eulogies\u2014who came from a house without running water or electricity and rose to the pinnacle of power. A story of a man who was at once driven and devoted to making real the words of his Savior and the ideals of this Nation. A story of a man who never let the tides of politics divert him from his mission to serve and shape the world.The man had character. Jimmy held a deep Christian faith in God and that his candidacy spoke and wrote about. Faith as a substance of things hoped for and evidence of the things not seen. Faith founded on commandments of Scripture: Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy mind and all thy soul and love thy neighbor as thyself. Easy to say, but very, very difficult to do.In his life\u2014in this life, any walk of faith can be difficult. It can be lonely. But it requires action to be the doers of the world.But in that commandment lies the essence, in my view, found in the Gospel, found in many faith traditions, and found in the very idea of America. Because the very journey of our Nation is a walk of sheer faith to do the work, to be the country we say we are, to be the country we say we want to be. A nation where all are created equal in the image of God and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.We've never fully lived up to that idea of America. But we've never walked away from it either, because of patriots like Jimmy Carter.Throughout his life, he showed us what it means to be a practitioner of good works and a good and faithful servant of God and of the people.And today, many think he was from a bygone era. But, in reality, he saw well into the future. A White Southern Baptist who led on civil rights. A decorated Navy veteran who brokered peace. A brilliant nuclear engineer who led on nuclear nonproliferation. A hard-working farmer who championed conservation and clean energy. And a President who redefined the relationship with the Vice President.Jimmy and I often talked about our dear friend Walter Mondale, whom we all miss very much. Together, they formed a model partnership of collaboration and trust, as both were men of character.And as we all know, Jimmy Carter also established a model post-Presidency by making a powerful difference as a private citizen in America and, I might add, as you all know, around the world.Through it all, he showed us how character and faith start with ourselves and then flows to others. At our best, we share the better parts of ourselves: joy, solidarity, love, commitment\u2014not for reward, but in reverence for the incredible gift of life we've all been granted.To make every minute of our time here on Earth count, that's the definition of a good life, a life Jimmy Carter lived during his 100 years. To young people, to anyone in search of meaning and purpose, study the power of Jimmy Carter's example.I miss him, but I take solace in knowing that he and his beloved Rosalynn are reunited again.And to the entire Carter family, thank you\u2014and I mean this sincerely\u2014for sharing them both with America and the world. We love you all.Jill and I will cherish our visits with them, including that last one in their home. We saw Jimmy as he always was: at peace, with a life fully lived. A good life of purpose and meaning, of character, driven by destiny and filled with the power of faith, hope, and love. I'll say it again: faith, hope and love.As he returned to Plains, Georgia, for his final resting place, we can say goodbye. In the words of the prophet Micah, who Jimmy so admired until his final breath, Jimmy Carter did justly, loved mercy, walked humbly.May God bless a great American and a dear friend and a good man. May he rise up\u2014be raised up on eagle's wings and bear you on the breath of dawn and make you to shine like the Sun and hold you in the palm of His hand.God bless you, Jimmy Carter.NOTE: The President spoke at 11:31 a.m. at the Washington National Cathedral.

        "Content":"\nDCPD202500035Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Statement on Efforts To Expand Veterans BenefitsJanuary 8, 2025As a nation, there is no more sacred obligation than properly preparing those we send into harm's way and taking care of them and their families when they come home. This is especially critical when we know that many who return home experience long-term health problems related to their service. That's why, as President, I have made supporting veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors a key priority and central to my unity agenda for the Nation.Among my key priorities for supporting veterans has been addressing the harmful toxic exposures that are too often associated with military service. Agent Orange, radiation, burn pits, and other hazards create devastating consequences for those exposed. When I signed the PACT Act into law in 2022, I enacted the most significant expansion of benefits and services for toxic- exposed veterans in more than 30 years. This law has been transformational and has enabled VA to serve more veterans, more quickly than ever before. And I've directed my administration to accelerate all aspects of implementing the law, including using new PACT Act authorities to make sure that more conditions could be recognized as presumptive, lowering the burden of proof for veterans to receive disability benefits related to toxic illnesses, including cancer.Today I'm proud that VA is adding more cancers to the list of those presumed related to burn pit exposure. This includes bladder cancer, ureter cancer, other genitourinary cancers, acute and chronic leukemias, and multiple myeloma. Veterans with these conditions, as well as survivors of veterans who passed away due to these conditions, can immediately apply for benefits. I encourage them to do so.These actions build upon other recent announcements to expand eligibility for GI bill benefits, lower health care costs for veterans, and increase resources to help eliminate, bringing veteran homelessness to a record low in 2024. It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve as Commander in Chief and to support and care for our servicemembers, veterans, and their families.Categories: Statements by the President : Veterans benefits, expansion efforts.Subjects: Cancer research, prevention, and treatment; Homelessness, prevention and reduction efforts; U.S. servicemembers, environmental exposures in war zones; Veterans benefits; Veterans, health and medical care.DCPD Number: DCPD202500035.\n"

Biden, Jr., 2025Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the 2024 Federal Programs and Services Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Republic of PalauJanuary 14, 2025Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)Consistent with Section 204(e) of the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2024 (Div. G, title II, P.L. 118\u201342) and section 101(d)(2) of the Joint Resolution to approve the \"Compact of Free Association\" between the United States and the Government of Palau, and for other purposes (P.L. 99\u2013658), I transmit here the 2024 Federal Programs and Services Agreement between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Republic of Palau (2024 Palau FPSA).Consistent with section 101(f) of title I of the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003 (P.L. 108\u2013188) and Section 204(e) of the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2024 (Div. G, title II, P.L. 118\u201342) I transmit here the 2024 Federal Programs and Services Agreement between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands with Annexes (2024 Marshall Islands FPSA).The reasons for these agreements with Palau and the Marshall Islands are to assist in their development and maintain our close relationship with each country. The 2024 FPSA agreements with Palau and the Marshall Islands would continue most of the services specified in those agreements as they have been provided to each country under previous agreements, with some technical updates. The 2024 FPSAs include significant changes to the provision of postal services for both Palau and the Marshall Islands, including more detailed specifications on the minimum level of services provided, allowing the United States Postal Service (USPS) to reduce the individual services within certain categories. The 2024 FPSA with Palau would also make FDIC insurance available to Palau-chartered banks for the first time, such that existing and future Palau- chartered depository institutions would be eligible to apply for FDIC insurance. A new component of the 2024 FPSA with the Marshall Islands would make FDIC insurance available to existing Marshall Islands-chartered institutions, such that they could apply for FDIC insurance. In addition, the 2024 FPSAs' general provisions that apply to all U.S. Federal agencies providing programs and services in Palau and the Marshall Islands\u2014not just those providing programs and services under the FPSAs\u2014would last in perpetuity unless terminated by mutual agreement. This ensures that benefits for U.S. Federal agencies, personnel, and contractors, including certain privileges and immunities, tax exemptions, and claims and dispute settlement procedures, will continue beyond 2043. With regard to the 2024 FPSA with the Marshall Islands, significant changes relating to disaster assistance include a revision to the process for declaring disasters, increased contributions to the Disaster Assistance Emergency Fund, and changes to promote disaster preparedness.I commend to the Congress the 2024 Palau FPSA between the United States of America and the Republic of Palau and the 2024 Marshall Islands FPSA between the United States of America and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.Sincerely,Joseph R. Biden Jr.NOTE: Identical letters were sent to J. Michael Johnson, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Kamala D. Harris, President of the Senate.

Biden, Jr., 2025Statement on Signing an Executive Order on Advancing United States Leadership in Artificial Intelligence InfrastructureJanuary 14, 2025The United States leads the world at the frontier of artificial intelligence (AI). Cutting-edge AI will have profound implications for national security and enormous potential to improve Americans' lives if harnessed responsibly, from helping cure disease to keeping communities safe by mitigating the effects of climate change. However, we cannot take our lead for granted.We will not let America be outbuilt when it comes to the technology that will define the future, nor should we sacrifice critical environmental standards and our shared efforts to protect clean air and clean water.That is why today, I am signing an historic Executive order to accelerate the speed at which we build the next generation of AI infrastructure here in America, in a way that enhances economic competitiveness, national security, AI safety, and clean energy.This Executive order will direct the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy to lease Federal sites where the private sector can build frontier AI infrastructure at speed and scale. These efforts are designed to accelerate the clean energy transition in a way that is responsible and respectful to local communities, and in a way that does not impose any new costs on American families.These efforts also will help position America to lead the world in clean energy deployment in the context of strategic competition abroad. Some of this new capacity will also be committed for use by small businesses and startups. This renewed partnership between the Government and industry will ensure that the United States will continue to lead the age of AI.NOTE: The statement referred to Executive Order 14141.Categories: Statements by the President : U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence infrastructure, advancement efforts, signing the Executive order.Subjects: Artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies; Renewable energy sources and technologies.DCPD Number: DCPD202500056.\n"

        "Title":"Proclamation 10882\u2014Establishment of the S\u00e1tt\u00edtla Highlands National Monument",
        "Date":"2025-01-14",
        "Content":"\nDCPD202500055Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Proclamation 10882\u2014Establishment of the S\u00e1tt\u00edtla Highlands National MonumentJanuary 14, 2025By the President of the United States of America A ProclamationIn northern California, the awe-inspiring geological wonders collectively described here as the S\u00e1tt\u00edtla Highlands have framed the homelands of Indigenous communities and cultures for millennia, and today this area continues to cradle historic and scientific treasures of our Nation. At this area's core rests a sleeping giant: the Medicine Lake Volcano. This massive volcano\u2014one of the two largest volcanos in the Cascades Volcanic Arc\u2014covers an expanse roughly 10 times that of Mount St. Helens, Washington. \"Medicine Lake,\" as labeled in English on some maps since approximately 1890, is found within the summit caldera of the volcano for which it is named. Far earlier and through the present day, however, these stunning and unusual lands have been known as \"S\u00e1tt\u00edtla\" in the Ajumawi language, which translates to \"obsidian place.\" S\u00e1tt\u00edtla's obsidian deposits formed by the volcano have long been important to Indigenous peoples, as shown by obsidian tools and sites they left here from their lives and travels. The S\u00e1tt\u00edtla Highlands area as described here includes parts of the Modoc, Shasta-Trinity, and Klamath National Forests, and stretches from Sharp Mountain, Wild Horse Mountain, and Little Horse Peak in the west, to Cougar Butte, Glass Mountain, and Border Mountain in the east, and to encompass the cinder cones known as Porcupine Butte, Timber Hill, Snag Hill, and Powder Hill in the south.S\u00e1tt\u00edtla includes portions of the ancestral homelands of the Pit River (Ajumawi \u2013 Atsugewi) and Modoc Peoples (Mo Wat Knii \u2013 Mo Docknii). For them and many other Indigenous peoples\u2014including the Karuk, Klamath, Shasta, Siletz, Wintu, and Yana and individual Tribes that are members of these groups\u2014the volcanic landscape holds and reflects exceptional power and is central to their spiritual beliefs and cultural practices. The Modoc believe Medicine Lake is a place of healing and have referred to the lake and its banks as \"Lani'shwi.\" Plants and animals found within S\u00e1tt\u00edtla's habitats include many that are rare or vulnerable and have long been important to the Indigenous peoples of the area for food, medicine, and ceremonies. S\u00e1tt\u00edtla's remarkable geologic formations and the ecosystems cultivated within and around them have shaped the history and cultures of generations of Indigenous peoples.This area contains evidence of human occupancy dating back at least 5,000 years. For members of the Pit River Tribe, S\u00e1tt\u00edtla, as part of the broader landscape within which it sits, is central to their creation stories and core to their physical, mental, spiritual, and cultural health. Their cultural and spiritual connections to S\u00e1tt\u00edtla reach across time and space, linking a web of heritage sites near and far and underscoring the importance of this land to the Indigenous people who have lived here throughout history. They believe that the people and the land are one in the same, not only that one cannot be separated from the other, but that one cannot exist without the other. S\u00e1tt\u00edtla's deep silence, local plants and animals, unobstructed views across the landscape, and pure water sources are necessary to carry out customs, traditions, and ceremonies of the Indigenous peoples connected to this area. This area has long provided a place for vision quests, gathering of medicinal plants, spiritual training and purification ceremonies, obsidian gathering, and religious activities that demand privacy, solitude, and unobscured access to both day and night skies. The night skies of S\u00e1tt\u00edtla, where distant galaxies and stars are visible, are renowned for being among the darkest in the United States.Located at the southern reaches of the Modoc Peoples' ancestral homelands, S\u00e1tt\u00edtla could be seen from across Modoc territory. The volcano and surrounding highlands were central to ceremonial life of the Modoc, and the area is an enduring place of historic and cultural significance. The area continues to serve as a place of gathering, healing, and spiritual importance for surrounding Indigenous peoples\u2014including the Karuk, Klamath, Shasta, Siletz, Wintu, and Yana. Tribal Nations collaborate in some of these activities, including ceremonies in and around Medicine Lake.At least 85 plant species found in S\u00e1tt\u00edtla are used by Indigenous peoples for healing, medicine, food, tools, building materials, and as ceremonial objects and are considered to have powerful medicinal and ceremonial uses. For example, Indigenous people used lichen from this area to dye materials used to adorn clothes and ornaments.Evidence of Indigenous peoples can be found throughout S\u00e1tt\u00edtla. Sites in various parts of the area exhibit evidence of obsidian quarrying and use by Indigenous peoples, with some containing unique assemblages of flaked stone and obsidian tools, waste materials from tool manufacture, and blades and cutting implements. Larger obsidian blades, including those quarried and found in S\u00e1tt\u00edtla, were highly prized as items of wealth and prestige in Indigenous cultures throughout the region. Obsidian quarried within S\u00e1tt\u00edtla was an important resource in a broad Indigenous trade network throughout northern California and the California Coast, and within southern Oregon. The Indigenous peoples of the region believe that distinct sources of S\u00e1tt\u00edtla obsidian\u2014such as obsidian deposits in the central part of this area\u2014retain special roles and significance in different uses. In various locations, evidence of precontact hunting blinds and groundstone implements also highlight that Indigenous peoples have lived and hunted across S\u00e1tt\u00edtla.In view of the importance of these lands to Indigenous peoples and the rich cultural resources found here, in 1999, the National Register of Historic Places determined approximately 33,000 acres of the S\u00e1tt\u00edtla area centered on Medicine Lake to be eligible as a Traditional Cultural Property District. Further, in 2007, the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management developed the Medicine Lake Highlands Historic Property Management Program, which extended this district to encompass approximately 73,000 acres.Indigenous peoples would likely have witnessed some of the more recent eruptions of the Medicine Lake Volcano\u2014which have occurred multiple times in the past 12,500 years and as recently as 950 years ago\u2014reshaping their sacred lands as they watched, and creating geologic formations and other objects still visible today. Future volcanic activity will likely continue to shape these highlands. As a result of its dynamic geology and millennia of human occupation, S\u00e1tt\u00edtla contains numerous objects of historic and scientific interest\u2014some formed by the volcano and surrounding ecosystems and others, like obsidian tools and ceremonial sites, created by Indigenous peoples\u2014and is integrally connected to the Indigenous Knowledge amassed by the Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples in the area over countless generations. Some of the objects in this area are sacred to Tribal Nations, are sensitive, rare, or vulnerable to vandalism and theft, or are unsafe to visit. Therefore, revealing their specific names or locations could pose a danger to the objects or to the public.The lava flows emanating off the flanks of Medicine Lake Volcano extend in every direction for more than 30 miles, through and, in some places, even beyond S\u00e1tt\u00edtla. Eons of historic geological activity provide visitors with vast panoramas of stark, unvegetated lava fields exemplified by the Burnt Lava Flow Geologic Special Interest Area in the southeast and the Callahan Flow in the north, and extending into Lava Beds National Monument along the northeast corner. The area's concentration of lava flows that are fewer than 13,000 years oldmakes S\u00e1tt\u00edtla one of the premier places to view geologically young lava flows in California\u2014 and in the United States.In addition to volcanologists who have come to S\u00e1tt\u00edtla to study and understand the depths of the earth's core, astronauts have also learned from the area. Between 1965 and 1967, the area's Pumice Crater\u2014located in the central portion of S\u00e1tt\u00edtla\u2014was used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for Apollo program astronauts who trained in the collection and identification of lunar-like geologic features to be prepared for observation and sampling on the moon. Multiple groups of astronauts traveled to the Pumice Crater area, and four of those astronauts flew Apollo missions, making this crater an important piece of space exploration history.Many of the lava flows within S\u00e1tt\u00edtla created islands of remnant forests that were elevated enough to escape the deluge of lava. In the north central area of S\u00e1tt\u00edtla, one such island is Black Lava Butte, which is dominated by shrubs, grasses, and old-growth ponderosa pine. Isolated from historical logging and development, these islands of forest provide valuable laboratories for future study of enduring and unaltered ecosystems.The southern portion of S\u00e1tt\u00edtla is home to miniature volcanoes known as spatter cones, a well-preserved and accessible handful of which appear adjacent to the Giant Crater Lava Flow located in the south-central portion of the area. S\u00e1tt\u00edtla's more than 100 cinder cones\u2014which are formed when lava cools mid-air and falls as fragments creating mounds, including Pumice Stone Mountain, Paint Pot Crater, and Porcupine Butte\u2014are intact, making them of particular scientific interest.The Fourmile Hill Tree Molds Geologic Area, situated on the north flank of the Medicine Lake volcano, contains dozens of molds formed over 12,000 years ago when molten lava flowed through a conifer forest leaving behind casts of the ancient tree trunks. These trace fossils can help improve scientists' understanding of the complex geologic history of the region.S\u00e1tt\u00edtla also contains hundreds of cave-like lava tubes, which were formed over time when molten basaltic lava flows cooled. Many of these formations are relatively unexplored, with more likely yet to be discovered through future scientific inquiry. The Giant Crater lava tube originates just south of Medicine Lake, extends southward within S\u00e1tt\u00edtla, and ultimately forms the longest known lava tube system in the world.S\u00e1tt\u00edtla is nearly devoid of surface water drainages, but its surface waters only hint at what is stored underground, as most of the precipitation that falls in this area filters down through the porous volcanic rock filling underground aquifers. These aquifers supply water to spring systems in northern California\u2014and ultimately to the Sacramento River to the south and the Lower Klamath and Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuges to the north.The first known Euro-American reports of S\u00e1tt\u00edtla emerged in 1826\u201327, with settler-driven development appearing in the region in the 1870s. The Tickner Road, constructed in 1871, served as one of the earliest routes across Siskiyou County, and remnants of two tracks are still visible in isolated sections in the northeast portion of the area.As Euro-Americans settled in the traditional homelands of the area's Indigenous peoples, many Tribal Nations suffered dispossession and, often, forced removal. The brutalities against them by Euro-Americans were systemic, as evidenced by California's first Governor declaring a \"war of extermination\" against the Indigenous peoples, and the California State Legislature appropriating a half-million dollars to pay for militia campaigns to kill them. By 1872, hostilities between the U.S. Army and the Modoc Peoples exploded into the Modoc War. Tickner Road was used by the U.S. military during the Modoc War as a supply route, and its remnants serve as a physical marker of this war. While battles took place in lava fields outside and to the north of thearea, some Modoc people sought refuge in S\u00e1tt\u00edtla, where they successfully avoided relocation after the war and ultimately integrated with the Klamath Tribes. For these members of the Modoc, their connection to and knowledge of the S\u00e1tt\u00edtla area proved life-saving. Other members were less fortunate; following the war several Modoc leaders were captured and hanged, and the remaining approximately 150 survivors were forcibly relocated to Oklahoma. In view of these atrocities and the resulting loss of homelands, S\u00e1tt\u00edtla and the objects it contains remain particularly significant both to the Modoc and to our Nation's history.The area's verdant forests and exceptional geology together have supported and still illustrate important parts of the region's history. For example, S\u00e1tt\u00edtla's high quality and accessible stands of ponderosa pine attracted the development of railroad logging operations, which came to this area at the end of the 19th century. Today, within the western and northern part of this area, visitors can see the remains of hundreds of miles of railroad grades, relics of logging camps, maintenance stations, loading and switchyards, and other traces from the railroad logging era.Near the center of S\u00e1tt\u00edtla, Little Mt. Hoffman Lookout Tower provides panoramic views across and outside of the area to distant Mt. Shasta, Mt. Lassen, and the Tule Lake Basin.Constructed in the 1920s, and eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, the tower was actively used as a wildfire lookout until 1978 and today it provides a chance to see much of the S\u00e1tt\u00edtla Highlands from the edge of the volcano's caldera.S\u00e1tt\u00edtla's exceptionally varied habitats also support high levels of biodiversity, including a variety of sensitive and endemic species. For example, the Federally listed northern spotted owl relies on mature forest habitat, which is scattered throughout the southern and western portions of S\u00e1tt\u00edtla. The area also partially overlaps the historic range of the Federally listed Franklin's bumblebee, which has one of the most limited geographic distributions of any bumblebee in the world. The Townsend's big-eared bat, a State of California Species of Concern, uses the region's lava tube caves for roosting. The Swainson's hawk returns from South America in the spring to breed in the low-elevation juniper forests, sagebrush, and bitterbrush habitats found along the northwestern edge of area. In the northern portion of S\u00e1tt\u00edtla, the Three Sisters Bald Eagle Winter Roost Area provides habitat for bald eagles, endangered in California. Scattered aquatic and riparian habitats in the western portion of the area support two State of California Species of Special Concern, the Cascades frog and long-toed salamander. Other species known to be north and south of S\u00e1tt\u00edtla, such as the Federally listed gray wolf, likely migrate through this area, with S\u00e1tt\u00edtla providing transitory habitat.S\u00e1tt\u00edtla supports the survival of at least 16 plants considered threatened, endangered, or rare in California, including the Federally listed whitebark pine growing near Garner Mountain in the western portion of the area, as well as a diverse community of fungi, with 20 species considered rare or sparsely distributed. Amongst host trees is the Pacific fuzzwort, a rare liverwort that is at the southern end of its habitat in northern California, and the sugarstick, a parasitic plant associated with the roots of old-growth conifers. As the climate continues to warm, high- elevation habitats within S\u00e1tt\u00edtla will remain critical refugia for species including the gray-headed pika and the Sierra Nevada red fox, a State of California threatened species.S\u00e1tt\u00edtla continues to provide traditional cultural resources used by Tribal and Indigenous communities, including food staples like sugar pine seeds and berries from gooseberry, currant, and manzanita, as well as plants collected for their medicinal properties, such as bitter cherry and Prince's pine. Various plants found in S\u00e1tt\u00edtla were historically used by Indigenous peoples for hunting, such as the blue elderberry whose pithy stem-wood was fashioned into elk whistles and is still collected today.S\u00e1tt\u00edtla's soils, formed from lava over time, are home to several sensitive plants, including the sensitive talus collomia, the snow fleabane daisy, little hulsea, and pyrola-leaved buckwheat, all of which are restricted to fewer than four counties in Northern California.At the lower elevations along the northwestern portion of S\u00e1tt\u00edtla, western juniper and ponderosa pine occur above a collection of Great Basin-type shrubs, including curl-leafmountain-mahogany, bitterbrush, rubber rabbitbrush, and big sage. The leaves, bark, flowers, and seeds from these shrubs were used by Indigenous peoples to make dye and medicines, and the dense wood of mountain-mahogany was used to make digging sticks, fire drills, bows, arrow shafts, and throwing sticks. Two species uncommon in California are found in the dry, volcanic soils near the northern boundary of S\u00e1tt\u00edtla: the tiny annual doublet and the cushion-like squarestem phlox.Wet meadows and fens are infrequent within the landscape, but where they occur, they provide habitat for wetland plant species such as the California-endangered Boggs Lake hedge- hyssop and the three-ranked hump moss. Traditional cultural plants found in these wetter habitats, including clover, yarrow, mountain strawberry, Baltic rush, and several grasses, were historically gathered for food, basket materials, and for their medicinal properties. Further, sensitive vernal pools are situated southeast of Medicine Lake, supporting species including Oregon sedge.Protection of S\u00e1tt\u00edtla will conserve the diverse array of cultural, precontact, historic, natural, and scientific resources\u2014that the volcano at its core has shaped\u2014for the benefit of all Americans. It is vital to preserve this unique geologic landscape that holds sites and objects of historical, traditional, cultural, and spiritual significance for Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples who have gathered Indigenous Knowledge and practiced and shaped their cultures linked integrally to this area over countless generations. In addition to containing numerous objects of historic and scientific interest as described above, this area also provides exceptional outdoor recreational opportunities, including hiking, biking, snowmobiling, camping, hunting, scenic driving, and canoeing.Whereas, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (the \"Antiquities Act\"), authorizes the President, in the President's discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected; andWhereas, S\u00e1tt\u00edtla has long been profoundly sacred to Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples with ties to these highlands; andWhereas, I find that all the objects identified above, and objects of the type identified above within the area described herein, are objects of historic or scientific interest in need of protection under section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, regardless of whether they are expressly identified as objects of historic or scientific interest in the text of this proclamation; andWhereas, I find that there are threats to the objects identified in this proclamation, and in the absence of a reservation under the Antiquities Act, these objects are not adequately protected by applicable law or administrative designations, thus making a national monument designation and reservation necessary to protect the objects of historic and scientific interest identified above for current and future generations; andWhereas, I find that the boundaries of the monument reserved by this proclamation represent the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects of scientific or historic interest identified above, as required by the Antiquities Act; andWhereas, it is in the public interest to ensure the preservation, restoration, and protection of the objects of scientific and historic interest identified above;Now, Therefore, I, Joseph R.

        "Date":"2025-01-14",
        "Content":"\nDCPD202500054Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Proclamation 10881\u2014Establishment of the Chuckwalla National MonumentJanuary 14, 2025By the President of the United States of America A ProclamationIn southeastern California, where the Mojave and Colorado Deserts intersect, ancient trails weave through a land of canyon-carved mountain ranges bound together by radiating alluvial bajadas and dark tendrils of dry wash woodlands. Sharing a name with the wide-bodied lizard that is commonly found here and derived from the Cahuilla word \"\u010d\u00e1xwal,\" the Chuckwalla region is a place of wonder that lies within the traditional homelands of the Iviatim (Cahuilla), N\u00fcw\u00fc (Chemehuevi), Pipa Aha Macav (Mojave), Kwats\u00e1an (Quechan), Maara'yam and Marringayam (Serrano), and other Indigenous peoples. It is imbued with religious, spiritual, historic, and cultural significance for Tribal Nations that trace their origins to these lands. The area contains an abundance of artifacts attesting to its connection to diverse human communities over thousands of years. The region's mosaic of habitats is also home to a remarkable array of plant and animal species. The dramatic contortions of its mountain ranges embody a fundamental story about the shaping of our world that scientists are still learning to decipher. The cultural, geologic, and ecological resources on Federal lands in the Chuckwalla region will continue to inspire and fascinate people and provide a scientific research trove for generations to come.The Chuckwalla region comprises five geographically discrete areas located between Joshua Tree National Park and the Palen\/McCoy Wilderness to the north, California State Route 78 to the east, the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range to the south, and the western boundary of the Mecca Hills Wilderness to the west. Woven together by the physical threads of Indigenous trails that radiate outward connecting peoples and places throughout the Southwest, the region carries significant cultural and sacred meaning for many Tribal Nations. The southern area is a vast and intact expanse of austere, beautiful mountain ranges and desert valleys stretching from the Mecca Hills and Orocopia Mountains in the northwest, to the Mule and Palo Verde Mountains in the northeast, and to the mesquite-studded draws of the Milpitas Wash in the southeast. The other four areas, which lie in the transition zone between the Mojave and Colorado deserts, are located at the base of the Cottonwood, Eagle, Coxcomb, and Palen Mountains.The imprints of generations of Indigenous peoples are found throughout the region in the trails, tools, habitation sites, and spectacular petroglyphs and pictographs they left behind. The Chuckwalla region has also been marked by the passage of people on the major prehistoric and historic travel corridors that connected the region to the Pacific coast and the interior southwest. While only a small fraction of the region has been formally inventoried, myriad cultural resources have been documented, and there are likely similar historic sites and objects yet to be discovered. A few sites are well-known and easily accessible to the public; many others are concealed in labyrinths of rugged canyons and have not yet been formally studied.Trails within the area helped to link important resources and people across the Indigenous homelands of the Chuckwalla region. For centuries, they facilitated trade and cultural exchange between peoples throughout the Southwest. Weaving through canyons, the trails connected indispensable water and other resources throughout the area. They were, and are, essential to the people who trace their origins to these lands, and provide a sense of connection between generations and between the physical and spiritual worlds.In some places, the footfalls of past generations have etched these trails into the region's surface, wearing a clear path into desert pavement. Ceramics and lithic scatter are also commonly found along trail routes within the Chuckwalla region. The endless shifting of sand and alluvium have likely obscured artifacts in some locations. A prehistoric travel route ran through the core of the northern area between the Eagle and Coxcomb Mountains, connecting the Pinto Basin, where some of California's oldest artifacts have been found, and the Chuckwalla Valley. The relatively narrow gap between the Eagle and Coxcomb Mountains traversed by the corridor also creates the conditions for flash floods; as a result, artifacts are likely to be found below the surface of the wash rather than on its surface.At least two trails that traverse the Chuckwalla region are sacred to Tribal Nations and bind their members to the land and to generations past. These trails, of which physical traces remain, are both ancient and modern, tangible places and passages that Tribes and Indigenous peoples evoke and visit through songs and dreams. Two versions of the Salt Song Trail pass through the region, connecting it to Tribal communities and sacred sites throughout the Southwest physically and through songs describing corridors, viewsheds, and the related geography and resources.While the Salt Song Trail can be traveled by foot, traditional singers also travel this trail by voice through songs passed down across generations and that Tribes and Indigenous peoples believe assist the transport of the spirits of the recently deceased.The Xam Kwatchan Trail, which parallels the Colorado River in the vicinity of the Mule and Palo Verde Mountains along the eastern edge of the southern area, is maintained by the Quechan people and recognized by many other Tribes of the Lower Colorado River. Portions of the Xam Kwatchan Trail are still visible and may be traveled physically as the trail weaves through the area and links together three sacred peaks of the Southwest: Avi Kwa Ame to the north of the Chuckwalla region near Lake Mead, Palo Verde Peak within the southern Chuckwalla region and overlooking the Colorado River, and Pilot Knob to the south of the Chuckwalla region near Yuma, Arizona. It is a belief of the Quechan people that they also travel this trail through dreams to transport the living and deceased, and to tie them to these lands and to their origin at Avi Kwa Ame. The Palo Verde and Mule Mountains encompass sites of particular significance along this trail. The eastern side of the Palo Verde Mountains is particularly dense with evidence of human habitation, including trails, camp spots, and ceremonial fire hearths.The Chuckwalla region has no perennial streams or lakes, but hidden within the southern area's mountain ranges are springs and natural seasonal water catchments (often referred to as tanks). Knowledge of these water sources has allowed Indigenous people to survive within this arid environment for thousands of years. The locations surrounding these springs and tanks are replete with artifacts, including stone tools, ceramics, remnants of habitations, and a dazzling array of petroglyphs and pictographs. In some places, the patina of naturally created desert pavement has been scraped away to form circles and images known as geoglyphs.In a wide canyon at the heart of the Chuckwalla Mountains lies Corn Springs, a well-known cultural site. Amid the mountain range's rugged peaks and dry washes, the oasis at Corn Springs, which supports a stand of more than 60 California fan palms, has long been a beacon to the area's human occupants. Corn Springs contains extensive petroglyphs encompassing a diverse array of elements and representing contributions by many people over thousands of years. These petroglyphs, which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, are carved into flat planes on the golden rocks found near Corn Springs.Jutting from the desert floor north of Corn Springs, in an area just south of the community of Desert Center, sits Alligator Rock. A salient ridge containing dikes of aplite, Alligator Rock was both a milestone on the major Indigenous travel and trade route that passed through ChuckwallaValley and an important prehistoric source of lithic materials. Flakes and tools crafted from thearea's distinctive speckled stone have been documented in sites throughout Chuckwalla Valley.In the eastern area, northeast of Alligator Rock and Corn Springs and north of the Little Chuckwalla Mountain Wilderness, Ford Dry Lake is now a sparsely vegetated playa in the Chuckwalla Valley at the base of the Palen and McCoy Mountains. Dense cultural sites have been documented along the lake's ancient shorelines, attesting to its use by generations of Indigenous peoples. Artifacts uncovered here include a variety of stone tools, ceramics, and other evidence of Indigenous habitation sites.While seemingly inhospitable to humans, the Chuckwalla region has provided sustenance and material resources to the Indigenous peoples who have inhabited and traversed it for generations. Many of the region's native plants were gathered for food, including mesquite and ironwood seeds, wild grasses, and cacti. Mesquite, which thrives in the dry washes of the southern area between the Chocolate and Palo Verde Mountains, was a particularly important source of sustenance. Large quantities of the beans were collected in the summer and stored for use throughout the year. In 1972, a large ceramic olla (an earthenware vessel) containing mesquite beans was discovered in a rock shelter in the canyon-striated Mecca Hills of the far western corner of the southern area.By the mid-1800s, the Chuckwalla region had caught the attention of non-Indigenous Americans seeking wealth in the underbelly of its mountains. In the 1860s, the Mule Mountains\u2014near the California-Arizona border\u2014were the site of one of the first discoveries of gold in Riverside County. Two decades later, the largest gold rush in Riverside County's history occurred when gold and silver were discovered in the Chuckwalla Mountains. Relics of historic mines, including shafts, trenches, equipment, and remnants of buildings, are present throughout the region's mountain ranges. A mining shaft, conveyor, and loading dock associated with the Model Mine, which operated around the turn of the last century, are located in the western foothills of the Chuckwalla Mountains.In 1862, as gold seekers spread throughout the region, a miner named William Bradshaw sought to develop a route to connect the Coachella Valley with expanding mines on the east side of the Colorado River. A Cahuilla leader and another Indigenous trail runner provided Bradshaw with a map of existing Indigenous routes linking springs and tanks along the southern edge of the Orocopia, Chuckwalla, and Little Chuckwalla Mountains. He used the knowledge shared with him of these existing Indigenous trails to identify what became known as the \"Bradshaw Trail,\" an overland route that traverses the Chuckwalla Bench through the heart of the southern area.Some of the springs and tanks, which had long been used by Indigenous peoples, became stagecoach stations associated with the Bradshaw Trail. Intrepid visitors can still drive the unpaved Bradshaw Trail, which the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) designated as a National Backcountry Byway in 1992.In 1942, shortly after the United States entered World War II, the Department of the Army established a presence in the Chuckwalla region, reminders of which can still be seen across the terrain. In March of 1942, Major General George Patton selected a large swath of desert in California and Nevada, including a substantial amount of land in the Chuckwalla Valley, for a Desert Training Center to prepare United States Army units for desert combat. By the end of World War II, over a million soldiers had been trained at the facility. Small unit training exercises were held in Chuckwalla Valley, which the Army believed provided the best approximation of terrain they might face in parts of North Africa. The scars of tank tracks across the southern area's desert pavement can still be seen today, along with berms, trenches, and foxholes.The Chuckwalla region includes the footprint of Camp Young, the Desert Training Center'sfirst camp and its administrative core. Camp Young was primarily located south of present-dayJoshua Tree National Park and north of Interstate 10 in the western area. While none remain standing, Camp Young boasted almost 100 administrative buildings, two hospitals, 50 warehouses, a theater, an officers' club, and a post office. Traces of the soldiers' lives at Camp Young can still be seen here, including rock-lined walkways and remnants of concrete foundations.During his tenure at the Desert Training Center, General Patton lived at Camp Young but was in the field on a daily basis, including to review small unit training exercises in the Chuckwalla Valley. He would often shout orders into a radio while observing tank maneuvers from a hill overlooking the valley between the Orocopia and Chuckwalla Mountains, in the center of the Chuckwalla region's southern area. The road bulldozed for Patton's use to the top of this hill, known as \"The King's Throne,\" remains clearly visible.Against this backdrop of human history, the Chuckwalla region's many and varied plant and animal inhabitants have continued to persevere in the harsh desert environment. The region provides a refuge for more than 50 rare plants and animals, as well as 21 vulnerable vegetation communities. The diversity of biota has attracted numerous scientists over many decades who have conducted research into topics as varied as testing translocation methods for bighorn sheep, studying ant colony forming behavior, and documenting the demographic patterns of the Orocopia sage, a shrub with delicate lavender flowers that is only known to grow in the Mecca Hills and Orocopia and Chocolate Mountains.The broad bajadas of the southern area radiate out from a series of small mountain ranges, whose sinuous canyons and ragged peaks provide habitat to a variety of species. The washes and sandy slopes of the Orocopia Mountains are home to Orocopia sage. The Mecca aster is endemic to only a small area, with more than half of its known occurrences located in the Mecca Hills.Mountain areas in the Chuckwalla region are also the only known locations of the recently described Chuckwalla cholla, a relatively low-lying cactus with reddish flowers.Desert bighorn sheep, a sensitive species with declining numbers, live year-round on the craggy slopes of the Orocopia and Chuckwalla Mountains and are occasionally glimpsed in the Palo Verde and Little Chuckwalla Mountains. The broad, sandy washes that connect the mountains\u2014unbroken by paved roads or large developments\u2014provide the habitat connectivity necessary to preserve genetic diversity among bighorn sheep populations.The region's expanse of gently sloping shrubby terrain is also vital to the survival of the threatened Agassiz's desert tortoise, encompassing key components of an essential corridor connecting the tortoise's Chuckwalla and Chemehuevi populations. Much of the region is critical habitat for this charismatic desert dweller.Located in the southern area of the Chuckwalla region, the Chuckwalla Bench is an elevated area of alluvial fans that provided a setting for extensive study and monitoring of desert tortoises for decades. It is also home to over 150 native plant species. The specific species present change with elevation as the bench's slopes climb to an 80,000-acre expanse that rises to approximately 2,000 feet in elevation, resulting in an environment that is notably cooler and wetter than is typical for the Sonoran Desert. At the higher elevations, Mojave yucca and cholla become increasingly common. The Munz's cholla, a species endemic to the Chuckwalla Bench whose spiny, branching arms often reach a height of six feet, grows here.In part because of the relative availability of forage and water, the Chuckwalla Bench is included in the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's primary area of interest for Sonoran Desert pronghorn reintroduction in California. In 1941, around the time that the United States Army began desert training in the area, the endangered Sonoran Desert pronghorn was lastobserved in the Colorado Desert in the vicinity of Salt Creek Wash, which runs between the Orocopia and Chocolate Mountains.Dry washes in the Chuckwalla region are threaded with populations of desert trees including ironwood, blue palo verde, smoketree, and mesquite. These are known as microphyll woodlands, and they provide migration corridors for desert wildlife, as well as crucial habitat for migratory birds. Milpitas Wash, located south of the Palo Verde Mountains in the southern area near the Arizona border, is one of the largest remaining microphyll woodlands in the Colorado Desert. It is identified as a component of the National Audubon Society's Colorado Desert Microphyll Woodlands Important Bird Area. Old-growth blue palo verde trees in Milpitas Wash provide nesting cavities for an important population of Gila woodpeckers, which are listed as endangered under the California Endangered Species Act. Rare long-eared owls, Crissal thrashers, and black- tailed gnatcatchers also nest in Milpitas Wash.Dense pockets of palo verde microphyll woodland occur in the northeast portion of the southern Chuckwalla region and are reported to have the highest winter bird densities in the California Desert. Sand dunes have dammed several small washes in the area, creating relatively wet conditions that are conducive to dense vegetative growth. These sand dunes in Chuckwalla Valley are fed by aeolian (windblown) sand transport corridors. In addition to the rich cultural sites associated with Ford Dry Lake, the portion of the Chuckwalla Valley in the eastern Chuckwalla region protects part of these sand transport corridors. The dunes in this area also provide habitat for the rare Mojave fringe-toed lizard.Nightfall reveals another dimension of the Chuckwalla region. Kit foxes and sensitive species such as burrowing owls and elf owls emerge from dens, while a variety of rare bats including the California leaf-nosed bat, the western mastiff bat, and the western yellow bat dart through the desert sky. Mountain lions are also known to prowl the Chuckwalla region at night. A population of mountain lions in southern California and the central coast of California, which includes those in the Chuckwalla region, is currently a candidate species under consideration for listing under the California Endangered Species Act.The Chuckwalla region encompasses striking geologic diversity, which both underpins the rich ecological and cultural values and is itself the focus of extensive research. In the far western reach of the southern area of this region, the Mecca Hills, shaped by the unquiet presence of the San Andreas Fault, attract not only hikers eager to explore their intricate canyons but a long line of geologists seeking to better understand fault dynamics. There is an exposure of Pliocene- Pleistocene terrestrial sedimentary rocks along the fault, and recent uplift and erosion have allowed the opportunity for its detailed analysis. Researchers have analyzed the Painted Canyon Fault, which lies within the San Andreas strike-slip fault zone in the Mecca Hills, to better understand tectonic processes along faults as far away as Denmark.Just to the east of the Mecca Hills, the Orocopia Mountains have been the site of extensive study of the geologic mechanisms that shape the earth, including deposition, metamorphism, uplift, and exposure. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Orocopia Mountains were the site of field training for the Apollo 13 and 15 crews, preparing them to observe and document lunar geology.In 1986, scientists documented five new species of mollusks from the Eocene epoch that were found in samples taken from the Orocopia Mountains, which helped clarify scientists' understanding of the timing of the westward migration of Eurasian mollusk species during the early Eocene and late Paleocene epochs. In the Palo Verde Mountains, at the southeastern edge of the Chuckwalla region, outcroppings of the Bouse Formation are helping scientists unlock mysteries around the formation of the Colorado River.Protecting the Chuckwalla region will preserve an important spiritual, cultural, prehistoric, and historic legacy and protect places inscribed with history for future generations; maintain a diverse array of natural and scientific resources; and help ensure that the prehistoric, historic, and scientific resources and values of the region endure for the benefit of all Americans. As described above, the region contains numerous objects of historic and scientific interest, and it provides exceptional outdoor recreational opportunities, including hiking, camping, backpacking, rockhounding, sightseeing, nature study, birding, horseback riding, hunting, climbing, mountain biking, and motorized recreation, all of which are important to the travel- and tourism-based economy of the region.Whereas, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (the \"Antiquities Act\"), authorizes the President, in the President's discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected; andWhereas, the Chuckwalla region has been profoundly sacred to Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples with ties to the Colorado and Mojave Deserts since time immemorial; andWhereas, it is in the public interest both to ensure the preservation, restoration, and protection of the objects of scientific and historic interest identified above and to advance renewable energy in Development Focus Areas (DFAs) that were identified by the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP) as of the date of this proclamation; andWhereas, I find that all the objects identified above, and objects of the type identified above within the area described herein, are objects of historic or scientific interest in need of protection under section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, regardless of whether they are expressly identified as objects of historic or scientific interest in the text of this proclamation; andWhereas, I find that there are threats to the objects identified in this proclamation, and, in the absence of a reservation under the Antiquities Act, the objects identified in this proclamation are not adequately protected by applicable law or administrative designations, thus making a national monument designation and reservation necessary to protect the objects of historic and scientific interest identified above for current and future generations; andWhereas, I find that the boundaries of the monument reserved by this proclamation represent the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects of historic or scientific interest identified above, as required by the Antiquities Act; andWhereas, it is in the public interest to ensure the preservation, restoration, and protection of the objects of historic and scientific interest identified above;Now, Therefore, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be the Chuckwalla National Monument (monument) and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as part thereof all lands and interests in lands that are owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, which is attached hereto and forms a part of this proclamation. These reserved Federal lands and interests in lands encompass approximately 624,270 acres. As a result of the distribution of the objects across the Chuckwalla region, the boundaries described on the accompanying map are confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects of historic or scientific interest identified above.All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of the monument are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, location, selection, sale, or other disposition under the public land laws, other than by exchange that furthers the protective purposes of the monument or that facilitates the remediation, monitoring, or reclamation of historic mining operations on public or private land within the monument boundary; from location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and from disposition under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing.The establishment of the monument is subject to valid existing rights. If the Federal Government subsequently acquires any lands or interests in lands not currently owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, such lands and interests in lands shall be reserved as a part of the monument, and objects of the type identified above that are situated upon those lands and interests in lands shall be part of the monument, upon acquisition of ownership or control by the Federal Government.Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to alter the valid existing water rights of any party, including the United States, or to alter or affect agreements governing the management and administration of the Colorado River, including any existing interstate water compact. This proclamation does not reserve water as a matter of Federal law.The Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), through the BLM, shall manage the monument pursuant to applicable legal authorities, as a unit of the National Landscape Conservation System, and in accordance with the terms, conditions, and management direction provided by this proclamation.For purposes of protecting and restoring the objects identified above, the Secretary shall within 3 years from the date of this proclamation prepare a management plan for the monument and shall promulgate such rules and regulations for the management of the monument as deemed appropriate.

        "Content":"\nDCPD202500103Administration of Donald J. Trump, 2025Inaugural AddressJanuary 20, 2025Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. [Applause] Wow. Thank you very, very much.Vice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my fellow citizens: The golden age of America begins right now.From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world.We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer. During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our Government will end.And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free. America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before.I return to the Presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.But first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America.As we gather today, our Government confronts a crisis of trust. For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.We now have a Government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while, at the same time, stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad.It fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens, but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions, that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.We have a Government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people.Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina\u2014who have been treated so badly\u2014and other States who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago or, more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense. They're raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now. They don't have a home any longer. That's interesting. But we can't let this happen.Everyone is unable to do anything about it. That's going to change.We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world.And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves, in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed, their freedom. From this moment on, America's decline is over.Our liberties and our Nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied. And we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America's Government.Over the past 8 years, I have been tested and challenged more than any President in our 250- year history, and I've learned a lot along the way. The journey to reclaim our Republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life.Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear. But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.That is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.For American citizens, January 20, 2025, is liberation day. It is my hope that our recent Presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country.As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural. And very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing States\u2014[applause]\u2014and the popular vote, we won by millions of people.To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records, and I will not forget it. I've heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.Today is Martin Luther King Day. And his honor\u2014this will be a great honor. But in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.National unity is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is soaring like never before. In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will not forget our country, we will not forget our Constitution, and we will not forget our God. [Applause] Can't do that.Today I will sign a series of historic Executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense.First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my \"Remain in Mexico\" policy.I will end the practice of catch-and-release. And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. Under the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our Government to use the full and immense power of Federal and State law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.As Commander in Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.Next, I will direct all members of my Cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices. The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth, and we are going to use it. We'll use it.We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.With my actions today, we will end the \"green new deal,\" and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers. In other words, you'll be able to buy the car of your choice.We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the autoworkers of our Nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote.I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources. The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before.To restore competence and effectiveness to our Federal Government, my administration will establish the brandnew Department of Government Efficiency.After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional Federal efforts to restrict free expression, I also will sign an Executive order to immediately stop all Government censorship and bring back free speech to America.Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents, something I know something about. [Laughter] We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again. Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.This week, I will also end the Government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit based. As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States Government that there are only two genders: male and female.This week, I will reinstate any servicemembers who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full backpay.And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty. It's going to end immediately. Our Armed Forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission: defeating America's enemies.Like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end and, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That's what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier. I'm pleased to say that as of yesterday, 1 day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families. [Applause] Thank you.America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on Earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world.A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and we will restore the name of a great President, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs.President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent\u2014he was a natural businessman\u2014and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United States\u2014the United States\u2014I mean, think of this\u2014spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal.We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, and Panama's promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape, or form. And that includes the United States Navy.And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor, and the vitality of history's greatest civilization.So, as we liberate our Nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred. Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free.The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons.And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.Ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and, right now, our Nation is more ambitious than any other. There's no nation like our Nation.Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls.Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth. No one comes close.Americans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens, and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand. If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. But as you see today, here I am. The American people have spoken. I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do. In America, the impossible is what we do best.From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, DC, our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride.Together, they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the 4 greatest years in American history. With your help, we will restore America promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love, and we love it so much.We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. So, to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. We're going to win like never before. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.In recent years, our Nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before. We will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage, and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.America will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith, and good will. We will be prosperous, we will be proud, we will be strong, and we will win like never before.We will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken, and we will not fail. From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign, and independent nation.We will stand bravely, we will live proudly, we will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans. The future is ours, and our golden age has just begun.Thank you. God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you.Thank you.NOTE: The President spoke at 12:10 p.m. in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. Prior to the address, Chief Justice of the United States John G.

        "Title":"Executive Order 14141\u2014Advancing United States Leadership in Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure",
        "Date":"2025-01-14",
        "Content":"\nDCPD202500057Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Executive Order 14141\u2014Advancing United States Leadership in Artificial Intelligence InfrastructureJanuary 14, 2025By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:Section 1. Purpose. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a defining technology of our era. Recent advancements in AI demonstrate its rapidly growing relevance to national security, including with respect to logistics, military capabilities, intelligence analysis, and cybersecurity. Building AI in the United States will help prevent adversaries from gaining access to, and using, powerful future systems to the detriment of our military and national security. It will also enable the United States Government to continue harnessing AI in service of national-security missions while preventing the United States from becoming dependent on other countries' infrastructure to develop and operate powerful AI tools.Advances at the frontier of AI will also have significant implications for United States economic competitiveness. These imperatives require building AI infrastructure in the United States on the time frame needed to ensure United States leadership over competitors who, already, are racing to take the lead in AI development and adoption. Building AI in the United States requires enormous private-sector investments in infrastructure, especially for the advanced computing clusters needed to train AI models and the energy infrastructure needed to power this work. Already, AI's electricity and computational needs are vast, and they are set to surge in the years ahead. This work also requires secure, reliable supply chains for critical components needed to build AI infrastructure, from construction materials to advanced electronics.This order sets our Nation on the path to ensure that future frontier AI can, and will, continue to be built here in the United States. In building domestic AI infrastructure, our Nation will also advance its leadership in the clean energy technologies needed to power the future economy, including geothermal, solar, wind, and nuclear energy; foster a vibrant, competitive, and open technology ecosystem in the United States, in which small companies can compete alongside large ones; maintain low consumer electricity prices; and help ensure that the development of AI infrastructure benefits the workers building it and communities near it.With this order, I provide a plan for protecting national security, preserving our economic competitiveness, revitalizing our energy infrastructure, and ensuring United States leadership in AI.Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to enable the development and operation of AI infrastructure, including data centers, in the United States in accordance with five guiding principles. When undertaking the actions set forth in this order, executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall adhere to these principles, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law:The development of AI infrastructure should advance United States national security and leadership in AI. Meeting this goal will require steps by the Federal Government, in collaboration with the private sector, to advance AI development and use AI for future national-security missions, including through the work described in National Security Memorandum 25 of October 24, 2024 (Advancing the United States' Leadership in Artificial Intelligence; Harnessing Artificial Intelligence to Fulfill National Security Objectives; and Fostering the Safety, Security, and Trustworthiness of Artificial Intelligence) (NSM\u201325). It will also require the use ofsafeguards to improve the cyber, supply-chain, and physical security of the laboratories at which powerful AI is developed, stored, and used. Additionally, protecting United States national security will require further work to evaluate and manage risks related to the powerful capabilities that future frontier AI may possess.The development of AI infrastructure should advance United States economic competitiveness, including by fostering a vibrant technology ecosystem. Already, AI is creating new jobs and industries, and its effects are being felt in sectors across the economy. The Federal Government must ensure that the United States remains competitive in the global economy, including through harnessing the benefits of this technology for all Americans. It must also promote a fair, open, and competitive AI ecosystem so that small developers and entrepreneurs can continue to drive innovation\u2014a priority highlighted in both Executive Order 14110 of October 30, 2023 (Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence), and NSM\u201325\u2014as well as to support secure, reliable supply-chain infrastructure for AI activities.The United States can and should lead the world in operating the next generation of AI data centers with clean power. Meeting this goal will require building on recent successes to modernize our Nation's energy infrastructure; improve permitting processes; and support investments in, and expeditious development of, both currently available and emerging clean energy technologies, such as geothermal energy, nuclear energy, and long-duration energy storage used to store clean energy, as well as relevant supply chains. The United States must not be surpassed in its support for the development, commercialization, and operation of clean energy technologies at home and abroad, and the rapid buildout of AI infrastructure offers another vital opportunity to accelerate and deploy these energy technologies. To help ensure that new data center electricity demand does not take clean power away from other end users, result in resource adequacy issues, or increase grid emissions, the construction of AI infrastructure must be matched with new, clean electricity generation resources.The development of AI infrastructure should proceed without raising energy costs for American consumers and businesses, and it should have strong community support. The companies developing, commercializing, and deploying AI must finance the cost of building the infrastructure needed for AI operations, including the development of next-generation power infrastructure built for these operations.The development of AI infrastructure should benefit those working to build it. Meeting this goal will require high labor standards and safeguards for the buildout of AI infrastructure, consultation and close collaboration with communities affected by this infrastructure's development and operation, and continuous work to mitigate risks and potential harms. The American people more broadly must safely enjoy the gains and opportunities from technological innovation in the AI ecosystem.Sec. 3. Definitions.

Biden, Jr., 2025Statement on Reaching a Cease-Fire and Hostage-Release Deal Between Israel and HamasJanuary 15, 2025Today, after many months of intensive diplomacy by the United States, along with Egypt and Qatar, Israel and Hamas have reached a cease-fire and hostage deal. This deal will halt the fighting in Gaza, surge much-needed humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians, and reunite the hostages with their families after more than 15 months in captivity.I laid out the precise contours of this plan on May 31, 2024, after which it was endorsed unanimously by the U.N. Security Council. It is the result not only of the extreme pressure that Hamas has been under and the changed regional equation after a cease-fire in Lebanon and weakening of Iran, but also of dogged and painstaking American diplomacy. My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done.Even as we welcome this news, we remember all the families whose loved ones were killed in Hamas's October 7 attack and the many innocent people killed in the war that followed. It is long past time for the fighting to end and the work of building peace and security to begin. I am also if thinking of the American families, three of whom have living hostages in Gaza and four awaiting return of remains after what has been the most horrible ordeal imaginable. Under this deal, we are determined to bring all of them home.I will speak more about this soon. For now, I am thrilled that those who have been held hostage are being reunited with their families.NOTE: The statement referred to Edan Alexander of Tenafly, NJ, who was captured during the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israel; Sagui Dekel-Chen, originally from Connecticut, who was kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7 attack; and Keith Siegel, originally from North Carolina, who was kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Kfar Az during the October 7 attack.Categories: Statements by the President : Israel and Hamas, cease-fire and hostage-release deal.

These 15 drugs, together with the 10 drugs that Medicare already negotiated, represent about a third of Medicare Part D spending on prescription drugs, which means the lower prices my Inflation Reduction Act is delivering will put money back in seniors' pockets across the country.My administration completed the first round of price negotiation last year and delivered dramatic savings, slashing the price of some of the most commonly used drugs in Medicare by about 40 to 80 percent.

The U.S. Conference of Mayors is an organization of character and consequence.And thanks to all of you, for your partnership in the progress we've made together these 4 years.I must say a big reason we got so much done is because all former mayors who served in my administration: Steve Benjamin, Pete Buttigieg, Marcia Fudge, Keisha Lance Bottoms, Mitch Landrieu, Tom Vilsack, Marty Walsh.And thanks to Tom Perez, a guy like me, who\u2014who has\u2014has been my point person for all of this, but he's a county guy. I\u2014uh, that's tougher, man. [Laughter] I don't know, man. [Laughter]This is one of the last events that I'll be doing as President. And the reason I chose to be here is because of\u2014the first things I did as President was to speak to this conference.You know, as many of you\u2014maybe you weren't here then, but many of you know I started my career as a local councilman. I only ran for the Senate because it was too damn hard being a local councilman. [Laughter]You know, people know where you live. [Laughter] They think you can solve every problem. Think you have more money than you do and more power than you do.You're on the front lines, answering key questions of their lives: \"Is my neighborhood safe?\" \"Is my kid going to have the good future to here in his hometown? Will there be jobs here?\" So many other questions. It matters. What you do matters, matters, matters.When we first met 4 years ago, the pandemic was raging, and our economy was reeling. Four years later, our Nation and our cities have emerged stronger than were when entered the crisis.And I come here today for a couple reasons. First, my administration released a report summarizing the impact of our work together to invest in America.It all started with the American Rescue Plan\u2014one of the most significant recovery packages in our history\u2014to get us out of the immediate crisis of the pandemic and save thousands of lives. One of the most important decisions I made was to send money directly to you\u2014directly to you.I've been a local official\u2014Governors are good guys and women, when you send it to the State legislatures, they divide in up before it gets to you. It goes directly to you when I do it, so you control the outcome.Then we passed the \"Invest in America\" Act that's launching a new\u2014a new\u2014era of American possibilities. One of the greatest modernizations of infrastructure in our history we passed: new roads, bridges, clean water, affordable high-speed internet for every American. I know each of you can list so many examples of the projects in your communities. There are thousands of them.We also made the biggest investment in fighting climate change ever in the history of the world, not just America\u2014[applause]\u2014because of you. And I think one thing we've all changed together, when I use the word\u2014hear \"climate,\" I think \"jobs.\" I think \"jobs\" when I hear \"climate.\"We're creating hundreds of thousands of good-paying clean energy jobs. We've proven you don't have to choose between protecting the environment and growing the economy. You're doing both.And we have to keep pushing forward and push forward faster. There is no time to waste.I've been with you and your Governors to make [in the wake of; White House correction] the devastating hurricanes and floods and tornadoes and wildfires, like the catastrophic fires in\u2014 wildfires in California. Together, we pushed Congress for extra disaster relief funding to rebuild homes and businesses across the Carolinas, to cover the full cost of replacing the collapsed Key Bridge in Baltimore, and so much more.At the same time, we've worked with you to upgrade the power grids, plant millions of trees, and build resilient communities to withstand\u2014withstand\u2014extreme weather, not only build but to build back better than before\u2014build back better.We also made the most significant investment in science and innovation. America invented the semiconductor, and now we're bringing those chip factories back home to America where they belong.I've stood with you in Columbus, Syracuse, Phoenix, and many more \"fields of dreams,\" where these fabs\u2014these massive new factories the size of several football fields\u2014are being built and I speak\u2014as I speak. And they're going to create at least 125,000 good-paying jobs.And the jobs in these fabs are going to pay over $100,000 a year, and you don't need a college degree. You don't have to move from your hometown. You can stay where you are.If I could pause for a minute, do you know what's going to happen as well? When you build these factories, they're going to have to build more barbershops, beauty salons. I'm not joking.We're going to build grocery stores. They're going to build drugstores. It grows communities in a big way.We will soon be the only economy in the world to have all five of the top chip companies operating in America, creating thousands of jobs.And for the first time in decades, these new factories are producing the most advanced chips right here in America. These aren't just fabs. These investments are creating opportunities for entire communities, for small business, creating even more jobs and so much more.I've kept my commitment to be President for all of America, whether you voted for me or not. In fact, studies show my programs have delivered more for red States than blue States.The results are clear: 16.6 million new jobs, the lowest average unemployment rate for 50 years\u2014in 50 years, a record 21 million new applications to start new businesses. And every one of those applications is an act of hope in your communities. Wages are up. Inflation is down.And we passed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years.We're slashing overdose deaths\u2014by 26 percent last year you did it\u2014faster than ever\u2014and seizing record amounts of fentanyl and making lifesaving Narcan available over the counter.Violent crime is now at a 50-year low. Because of you.The bottom line, you've produced an incredible 4 years. So much of we got done together will take time to see and feel though. But the seeds have been planted, will grow, and they'll bloom for decades to come. And not one\u2014none of it could have happened without all of you. I'm not\u2014that's not hyperbole. None of it.You know, we're not finished yet. Earlier today I announced three major priorities that mark important progress in our country.First, after fighting Big Pharma for decades as a Senator and then Vice President and as President, we finally beat Big Pharma. Instead of paying 400 bucks a month for insulin, seniors now pay $35 a month.But that wasn't the only thing that happened when we passed the bill. Starting this month, the total prescription drug costs for seniors is capped at $2,000, no matter how expensive their drugs are, even expensive cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $14,000, they're not going to have to pay more than $2,000 a year.And finally, we gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices like the VA has been able to do for veterans all along. These negotiations are being implemented in phases. The first phase negotiated a lower price for the 10 most expensive drugs for seniors, covering drugs for blood clots and so much more.And just this morning I announced the next phase\u2014the next 15 drugs subject to\u2014 negotiation. Drugs that will treat cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and so much more, including Ozempia\u2014excuse me, Ozempic.[At this point, the President gestured toward his tongue.][Laughter] Hard to say. [Laughter] But it was\u2014it really is an incredible drug.These reforms just don't save seniors money. They save the American taxpayer $160 billion\u2014[applause]\u2014the taxpayer over the next decade. Why? That $160 billion in Medicare issaving for negotiating lower drug prices with Big Pharma doesn't have to be paid out by the Government\u2014$160 billion.Second, just over 100 years ago, a pioneering group of women proposed the Equal Rights Amendment to enshrine the principles of gender equality into our Constitution. Throughout my career, I've been clear: No one\u2014no one\u2014no one should be discriminated against based on their sex. And in order for the amendment to be ratified, it requires three-fourths of the States to ratify it. That benchmark was passed\u2014benchmark was passed when Virginia ratified the ERA a few years ago.Today I affirmed the Equal Rights Amendment to have cleared all the necessary hurdles to be added to the U.S. Constitution now. [Applause] The Equal Rights Amendment is the law of the land now. [Applause] It's the 28th amendment to the Constitution now. I consulted dozens of constitutional scholars to make sure there was all within the power to do this, and the fact is, we did.And third, our cities are places for a second chance. Earlier today I commuted the sentence of nearly 2,500 convicted nonviolent drug offenders. These individuals are serving a disproportionally long and harsh sentence compared to the sentence they would receive had they committed the crime today. After spending too long behind bars, these individuals will soon be reunited with their families and communities.With this action, I make no\u2014I make no apology. I've issues more individual pardons and commutations than any President in U.S. history. There is more work to do, but when we\u2014when we allow our justice system to be placed\u2014a place for both accountability and mercy, it strengthens our cities and our Nation as well, in my view.Let me close with this. Serving as your President has been the honor of my life. While my term in office is ending, the work continues. Your work continues.In my farewell address 2 days ago, I talked how each of us must be guardians of democracy to restore the strength of our institutions and democracy. The Presidency, the Congress, the courts all have minimum requirements under the law to deal with those safeguards\u2014and a free and independent press and, yes, local governments. The strength of our institutions depends on the character of leaders like you.In our time together, I'm forever thankful to have seen the strength\u2014your strength and your character, and we need it now more than ever. The magic of America has been, everyone has a fair shot, everyone deserves to\u2014to be as determined to be able to be treated with dignity. No guarantees, just a fair shot.I've always believed America be defined in one word. I remember being on Tibetan Plateau with Xi Jinping. I've met with him for over a\u201490 hours alone, traveled 17,000 miles with him, very significant differences. He looked at me, and he said, \"Can you define America for me?\" And I said, \"In one word: possibilities.\"We're the only nation in the world\u2014only nation in the world\u2014that's come out of every crisis we ever gotten in stronger than we went in. Only one. Look at the history.And we're the only nation in the world that believes when we act together, there's not a damn thing we can't do. Only in America, we believe anything is possible.We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. Nothing is beyond our capacity when we do it together and act together.And God bless you all. Keep working together. We need you. We need you. We need you.We need you. And may God protect our troops. Thank you so very much.NOTE: The President spoke at 1:56 p.m. at the Marriott Marquis Washington, DC, hotel. In his remarks, he referred to Mayor Andrew J.

        "Content":"\nDCPD202500084Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Memorandum on Orderly Implementation of the Air Toxics Standards for Ethylene Oxide Commercial SterilizersJanuary 16, 2025Memorandum for the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of Health and Human ServicesSubject: Orderly Implementation of the Air Toxics Standards for Ethylene Oxide Commercial SterilizersBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:Section 1. Policy. The strengthened and updated Clean Air Act standards for ethylene oxide (EtO) emitted into the air from commercial sterilizing facilities issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on April 5, 2024, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Ethylene Oxide Emissions Standards for Sterilization Facilities Residual Risk and Technology Review, Final Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 24,090 (Apr. 5, 2024) (\"EtO Rule\"), achieved a new milestone in my Administration's efforts to protect public health for all Americans and to advance the objective of my Administration's Cancer Moonshot initiative to prevent cancer before it starts. EtO has been associated with elevated cancer risks in communities around the United States and can be particularly harmful to children. The loss of loved ones from environmentally related cancer is a tragedy that the Nation can and must work together to end, once and for all.The EtO Rule was issued after careful consideration of public comments and public hearings. In this rule, EPA set standards under section 112 of the Clean Air Act, as amended (the \"Act\") (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), to control emissions from commercial sterilizers through the use of demonstrated and achievable pollution control technologies and practices. These standards will significantly reduce emissions of the toxic air pollutant EtO.The EtO Rule applies to facilities that sterilize medical products, including medical devices and pharmaceuticals. Sterilization is critical to maintaining a safe supply of medical devices for patients and hospitals and providing health care to millions of Americans to help them stay healthy and fight diseases, including cancer. Consequently, EPA worked closely with the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Food and Drug Administration, to develop a final rule that protects communities exposed to pollution from sterilization facilities while also mitigating and managing the potential risk of any medical device supply disruptions.EPA concluded that sterilization facilities will be able to install the appropriate technology to meet the standards of the EtO Rule before the compliance deadlines mandated by the Act. The EtO Rule also recognized that the President's authority under section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412(i)(4), to exempt individual facilities from compliance for a set period of time may provide an important mechanism to address the possibility that a facility may be unable to install all appropriate technology before the compliance deadline. 89 Fed. Reg. at 24,103. It is of vital national importance to ensure the reduction of EtO emissions to the level that EPA determined is required to protect public health pursuant to the Clean Air Act, while also avoiding the national security and public health effects that could result from a significant disruption to the medical device supply chain.It is the policy of my Administration to safeguard the reliability of our Nation's supply of safe medical products. To advance orderly implementation of the EtO Rule, I am thereforeestablishing a process, provided below, for considering requests for Presidential exemptions, the duration of which shall be as short as possible and no longer than two years. This process will ensure consideration of such requests in the exceptional circumstances in which a commercial sterilizer can demonstrate that, notwithstanding due diligence and best efforts, it will be unable to meet a covered standard or limitation required by the EtO Rule before the compliance deadline due to the unavailability of control technology for the facility, leading to likely shutdown of the facility, and the best available information demonstrates that the shutdown of the facility will likely lead to a serious disruption to the supply of medical products, such as medical devices and pharmaceuticals, necessary for America's national security and public health.To achieve the EtO Rule's critical health protections as soon as practicable, while safeguarding the supply of safe medical products from disruption that would compromise the health and welfare of the American people, I direct you to take the following actions:Sec. 2. Implementation of a Process for Considering Presidential Exemptions. The Administrator of the EPA (Administrator) shall receive requests for a Presidential exemption from a standard or limitation in the EtO Rule under section 112(i)(4) of the Act (42 U.S.C.7412(i)(4)), review them, and advise the President regarding whether to grant them through the following process:Any commercial sterilizer seeking such an exemption shall submit a request to the Administrator no earlier than 12 months and no later than 4 months before the compliance deadline for which an exemption is sought. The request shall include:specific information of sufficient detail to enable verification of the reason or reasons that the technology to implement the applicable standard or limitation is unavailable for installation and that, notwithstanding its due diligence and best efforts, the facility cannot be brought into compliance before the compliance deadline for the covered standard or limitation (e.g., contracts, documentation of communication with vendors or suppliers);a plan for procuring, installing, and operating the technology as soon as feasible in order to achieve compliance with the EtO Rule, and an assurance as described in subsection (h)(ii) of this section;a list of all available practicable measures (i.e., technological and operational) that have already been taken or that are planned to advance compliance and additional measures, if any, that will be implemented to reduce the emissions of EtO and resulting risks during the exemption period;a list of any alternative steps available, in progress, or already taken to try to avoid the need for additional time for compliance;the type or types of products sterilized at the facility, the volume of products sterilized at the facility, and the facility's annual sterilization capacity; andthe name, title, and signature of the responsible official who is certifying the accuracy of the request.In reviewing an exemption request, and the information provided pursuant to this section, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary), shall consider:whether the technology to implement a covered standard or limitation will be unavailable in time for installation and operation of the technology at a specific facility before the compliance deadline for such standard or limitation, due, for example, toshortages of labor, parts, control technology supply, supply-chain disruption, or other factors out of the facility's control;the amount of time needed for installation and operation to occur in order to achieve compliance with the EtO Rule;the risk of a serious disruption to the supply of medical products (including pharmaceuticals and medical devices) should the facility be required to temporarily pause sterilization activities or reduce capacity until installation and operation can occur (including any potential alternatives to assure a sufficient supply of sterilization and sterilized medical products);the potential effect of any such disruption on public health and welfare, and any other information that may be relevant to an evaluation of whether granting an exemption is in the national security interests of the United States; and(vi) any other information that the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, deems relevant.No later than 30 days after receiving a request pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator shall confirm receipt of the request, notify the requester of any additional information needed to evaluate the request, set a deadline of no later than 15 days for the requester to provide the requested information, and provide public notification that the request was submitted (including the name of, the location of, and any other information regarding the facility requesting the exemption that the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, deems relevant and appropriate to publish).As soon as practicable and no later than 30 days after receiving all necessary information to evaluate a request pursuant to this section, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, shall provide the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) with the request and accompanying information from the requester, any additional information that the Administrator deems relevant, and a recommendation regarding whether an exemption is warranted, including the basis for the recommendation, and if recommending that the President grant an exemption: the recommended duration, and any other accompanying terms or conditions (such as a schedule for status reports regarding planned steps and progress to achieve compliance with the EtO Rule).As soon as practicable and generally within 45 days after receiving a recommendation from the Administrator pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the Chairman of CEQ, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, the Director of the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy, and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, shall advise the President concerning the request for an exemption.As expeditiously as practicable after the grant or denial of any exemption by the President under this process, and no later than 10 days after such a grant or denial, the Administrator shall notify the applicant.Within 60 days of the grant of any exemption by the President under this process, the Administrator shall make publicly available online the name of, location of, and any other appropriate and relevant information regarding the facility receiving the exemption and the duration of any exemption, and shall submit to Congress the report required by section 112(i)(4) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(i)(4)) on behalf of the President.The Administrator shall, as appropriate:provide technical assistance to any facility that receives an exemption to promote compliance with the EtO Rule;seek information and assurance from any facility that requests an exemption that the facility will use its best efforts and will take reasonable and appropriate steps to demonstrate diligent action to install and operate necessary technology as expeditiously as practicable (including to fulfill any accompanying terms or conditions) to achieve compliance with the EtO Rule; andinform the Chairman of CEQ when installation of such technology is complete.Sec. 3. Federal Coordination. The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator, shall consider taking additional steps, as appropriate, to further advance the goal of protecting the public from cancer and other harms from EtO exposure, including spurring innovation to reduce exposure to EtO and other carcinogenic air pollutants and to expand access to safe, effective, and reliable alternative methods for sterilization of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals that do not depend on EtO, and continuing to strengthen the resilience of our Nation's medical supply chain. Within 2 years of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary shall provide a report to the Chairman of CEQ regarding progress toward this directive and any steps taken or planned.Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; orthe functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.The Administrator is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.Joseph R. Biden, Jr.[Filed with the Office of the Federal Register, 2 p.m., January 16, 2025]NOTE: This memorandum was published in the Federal Register on January 17.Categories: Communications to Federal Agencies : Ethylene oxide commercial sterilizers, implementation of air toxics standards, memorandum.Subjects: Air quality, improvement efforts; Council on Environmental Quality; Environmental Protection Agency; Ethylene oxide commercial sterilizers, implementation of air toxics standards; Food and Drug Administration; Office of Management and Budget; Secretary of Health and Human Services.DCPD Number: DCPD202500084.\n"

        "Content":"\nDCPD202500082Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Executive Order 14144\u2014Strengthening and Promoting Innovation in the Nation's CybersecurityJanuary 16, 2025By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:Section 1. Policy. Adversarial countries and criminals continue to conduct cyber campaigns targeting the United States and Americans, with the People's Republic of China presenting the most active and persistent cyber threat to United States Government, private sector, and critical infrastructure networks. These campaigns disrupt the delivery of critical services across the Nation, cost billions of dollars, and undermine Americans' security and privacy. More must be done to improve the Nation's cybersecurity against these threats.Building on the foundational steps I directed in Executive Order 14028 of May 12, 2021 (Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity), and the initiatives detailed in the National Cybersecurity Strategy, I am ordering additional actions to improve our Nation's cybersecurity, focusing on defending our digital infrastructure, securing the services and capabilities most vital to the digital domain, and building our capability to address key threats, including those from the People's Republic of China. Improving accountability for software and cloud service providers, strengthening the security of Federal communications and identity management systems, and promoting innovative developments and the use of emerging technologies for cybersecurity across executive departments and agencies (agencies) and with the private sector are especially critical to improvement of the Nation's cybersecurity.Sec. 2. Operationalizing Transparency and Security in Third-Party Software Supply Chains.The Federal Government and our Nation's critical infrastructure rely on software providers. Yet insecure software remains a challenge for both providers and users and makes Federal Government and critical infrastructure systems vulnerable to malicious cyber incidents. The Federal Government must continue to adopt secure software acquisition practices and take steps so that software providers use secure software development practices to reduce the number and severity of vulnerabilities in software they produce.Executive Order 14028 directed actions to improve the security and integrity of software critical to the Federal Government's ability to function. Executive Order 14028 directed the development of guidance on secure software development practices and on generating and providing evidence in the form of artifacts\u2014computer records or data that are generated manually or by automated means\u2014that demonstrate compliance with those practices. Additionally, it directed the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to require agencies to use only software from providers that attest to using those secure software development practices. In some instances, providers of software to the Federal Government commit to following cybersecurity practices, yet do not fix well-known exploitable vulnerabilities in their software, which puts the Government at risk of compromise. The Federal Government needs to adopt more rigorous third-party risk management practices and greater assurance that software providers that support critical Government services are following the practices to which they attest.Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of the National Institute ofStandards and Technology (NIST), and the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), shall recommend to the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) contract language requiring software providers to submit to CISA through CISA's Repository for Software Attestation and Artifacts (RSAA):machine-readable secure software development attestations;high-level artifacts to validate those attestations; anda list of the providers' Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agency software customers.Within 120 days of the receipt of the recommendations described in subsection (b)(i) of this section, the FAR Council shall review the recommendations and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of General Services, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (the agency members of the FAR Council) shall jointly take steps to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to implement those recommendations. The agency members of the FAR Council are strongly encouraged to consider issuing an interim final rule, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law.Within 60 days of the date of the issuance of the recommendations described in subsection (b)(i) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall evaluate emerging methods of generating, receiving, and verifying machine-readable secure software development attestations and artifacts and, as appropriate, shall provide guidance for software providers on submitting them to CISA's RSAA website, including a common data schema and format.Within 30 days of the date of any amendments to the FAR described in subsection (b)(ii) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall develop a program to centrally verify the completeness of all attestation forms. CISA shall continuously validate a sample of the complete attestations using high-level artifacts in the RSAA.If CISA finds that attestations are incomplete or artifacts are insufficient for validating the attestations, the Director of CISA shall notify the software provider and the contracting agency. The Director of CISA shall provide a process for the software provider to respond to CISA's initial determination and shall duly consider the response.For attestations that undergo validation, the Director of CISA shall inform the National Cyber Director, who shall publicly post the results, identifying the software providers and software version. The National Cyber Director is encouraged to refer attestations that fail validation to the Attorney General for action as appropriate.Secure software development practices are not sufficient to address the potential for cyber incidents from resourced and determined nation-state actors. To mitigate the risk of such incidents occurring, software providers must also address how software is delivered and the security of the software itself. The Federal Government must identify a coordinated set of practical and effective security practices to require when it procures software.Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, shall establish a consortium with industry at the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence to develop guidance, informed by the consortium as appropriate, that demonstrates the implementation of secure software development,security, and operations practices based on NIST Special Publication 800\u2013218 (Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)).Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, shall update NIST Special Publication 800\u201353 (Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations) to provide guidance on how to securely and reliably deploy patches and updates.Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, in consultation with the heads of such agencies as the Director of NIST deems appropriate, shall develop and publish a preliminary update to the SSDF. This update shall include practices, procedures, controls, and implementation examples regarding the secure and reliable development and delivery of software as well as the security of the software itself. Within 120 days of publishing the preliminary update, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, shall publish a final version of the updated SSDF.Within 120 days of the final update to the SSDF described in subsection (c)(iii) of this section, the Director of OMB shall incorporate select practices for the secure development and delivery of software contained in NIST's updated SSDF into the requirements of OMB Memorandum M\u201322\u201318 (Enhancing the Security of the Software Supply Chain through Secure Software Development Practices) or related requirements.Within 30 days of the issuance of OMB's updated requirements described in subsection (c)(iv) of this section, the Director of CISA shall prepare any revisions to CISA's common form for Secure Software Development Attestation to conform to OMB's requirements and shall initiate any process required to obtain clearance of the revised form under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.As agencies have improved their cyber defenses, adversaries have targeted the weak links in agency supply chains and the products and services upon which the Federal Government relies. Agencies need to integrate cybersecurity supply chain risk management programs into enterprise-wide risk management activities. Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Director of OMB, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, the Administrator of General Services, and the Federal Acquisition Security Council (FASC), shall take steps to require, as the Director deems appropriate, that agencies comply with the guidance in NIST Special Publication 800\u2013161 (Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations (SP 800\u2013161 Revision 1)). OMB shall require agencies to provide annual updates to OMB as they complete implementation. Consistent with SP 800\u2013161 Revision 1, OMB's requirements shall address the integration of cybersecurity into the acquisition lifecycle through acquisition planning, source selection, responsibility determination, security compliance evaluation, contract administration, and performance evaluation.Open source software plays a critical role in Federal information systems. To help the Federal Government continue to reap the innovation and cost benefits of open source software and contribute to the cybersecurity of the open source software ecosystem, agencies must better manage their use of open source software. Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, and the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services and the heads of other agencies as appropriate, shall jointly issue recommendations to agencies on the use of security assessments and patching of open source software and best practices for contributing to open source software projects.Sec. 3. Improving the Cybersecurity of Federal Systems. (a) The Federal Government must adopt proven security practices from industry\u2014to include in identity and access management\u2014in order to improve visibility of security threats across networks and strengthen cloud security.To prioritize investments in the innovative identity technologies and processes of the future and phishing-resistant authentication options, FCEB agencies shall begin using, in pilot deployments or in larger deployments as appropriate, commercial phishing-resistant standards such as WebAuthn, building on the deployments that OMB and CISA have developed and established since the issuance of Executive Order 14028. These pilot deployments shall be used to inform future directions for Federal identity, credentialing, and access management strategies.The Federal Government must maintain the ability to rapidly and effectively identify threats across the Federal enterprise. In Executive Order 14028, I directed the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish procedures to immediately share threat information to strengthen the collective defense of Department of Defense and civilian networks. To enable identification of threat activity, CISA's capability to hunt for and identify threats across FCEB agencies under 44 U.S.C. 3553(b)(7) must be strengthened.The Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, in coordination with the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council and Federal Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Council, shall develop the technical capability to gain timely access to required data from FCEB agency endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions and from FCEB agency security operation centers to enable:timely hunting and identification of novel cyber threats and vulnerabilities across the Federal civilian enterprise;identification of coordinated cyber campaigns that simultaneously target multiple agencies and move laterally across the Federal enterprise; andcoordination of Government-wide efforts on information security policies and practices, including compilation and analysis of information about incidents that threaten information security.Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, in coordination with the Federal CIO and CISO Councils, shall develop and release a concept of operations that enables CISA to gain timely access to required data to achieve the objectives described in subsection (c)(i) of this section. The Director of OMB shall oversee the development of this concept of operations to account for agency perspectives and the objectives outlined in this section and shall approve the final concept of operations. This concept of operations shall include:requirements for FCEB agencies to provide CISA with data of sufficient completeness and on the timeline required to enable CISA to achieve the objectives described in subsection (c)(i) of this section;requirements for CISA to provide FCEB agencies with advanced notification when CISA directly accesses agency EDR solutions to obtain required telemetry;specific use cases for which agencies may provide telemetry data subject to the requirements in subsection (c)(ii)(A) of this section as opposed to direct access to EDR solutions by CISA;high-level technical and policy control requirements to govern CISA access to agency EDR solutions that conform with widely accepted cybersecurity principles, including role-based access controls, \"least privilege,\" and separation of duties;specific protections for highly sensitive agency data that is subject to statutory, regulatory, or judicial restrictions to protect confidentiality or integrity; andan appendix to the concept of operations that identifies and addresses certain types of specific use cases under subsection (c)(ii)(C) of this section that apply to the Department of Justice, including certain categories of information described in subsections (c)(vi) and (c)(vii) of this section, and requires the Department of Justice's concurrence on the terms of the appendix prior to implementation of the concept of operations on the Department of Justice's or its subcomponents' networks.In undertaking the activities described in subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall only make a change to an agency network, system, or data when such change is required for threat hunting by CISA, including access to the EDR tools described in subsection (c)(ii) of this section, or in furtherance of its authority to conduct threat hunting as authorized under 44 U.S.C. 3553(b)(7), unless otherwise authorized by the agency.Within 30 days of the release of the concept of operations described in subsection (c)(ii) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall establish working groups, open to all agencies, to develop and release specific technical controls that achieve the objectives set forth in subsection (c)(ii) of this section and to work with EDR solution providers to implement those controls in FCEB agency deployments of EDR solutions. The Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall, at a minimum, establish a working group for each EDR solution authorized by CISA for use in the CISA Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation Program. Each working group shall be open to all agencies and include at least one representative from an FCEB agency employing the designated EDR solution.Within 180 days of the release of the technical controls described in subsection (c)(iv) of this section, the heads of FCEB agencies shall enroll endpoints using an EDR solution covered by those controls in the CISA Persistent Access Capability program.Within 90 days of the date of this order, and periodically thereafter as needed, the heads of FCEB agencies shall provide to CISA a list of systems, endpoints, and data sets that require additional controls or periods of non-disruption to ensure that CISA's threat-hunting activities do not disrupt mission-critical operations, along with an explanation of those operations.In cases in which agency data is subject to statutory, regulatory, or judicial access restrictions, the Director of CISA shall comply with agency processes and procedures required to access such data or work with the agency to develop an appropriate administrative accommodation consistent with any such restrictions so that the data is not subject to unauthorized access or use.Nothing in this order requires an agency to provide access to information that is protected from non-disclosure by court order or otherwise required to be kept confidential in connection with a judicial proceeding.The security of Federal information systems relies on the security of the Government's cloud services. Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of General Services,acting through the Director of the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall develop FedRAMP policies and practices to incentivize or require cloud service providers in the FedRAMP Marketplace to produce baselines with specifications and recommendations for agency configuration of agency cloud-based systems in order to secure Federal data based on agency requirements.As cybersecurity threats to space systems increase, these systems and their supporting digital infrastructure must be designed to adapt to evolving cybersecurity threats and operate in contested environments. In light of the pivotal role space systems play in global critical infrastructure and communications resilience, and to further protect space systems and the supporting digital infrastructure vital to our national security, including our economic security, agencies shall take steps to continually verify that Federal space systems have the requisite cybersecurity capabilities through actions including continuous assessments, testing, exercises, and modeling and simulation.Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United States Geological Survey; the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall each review the civil space contract requirements in the FAR and recommend to the FAR Council and other appropriate agencies updates to civil space cybersecurity requirements and relevant contract language. The recommended cybersecurity requirements and contract language shall use a risk-based, tiered approach for all new civil space systems. Such requirements shall be designed to apply at minimum to the civil space systems' on-orbit segments and link segments. The requirements shall address the following elements for the highest-risk tier and, as appropriate, other tiers:protection of command and control of the civil space system, including backup or failover systems, by:encrypting commands to protect the confidentiality of communications;ensuring commands are not modified in transit;ensuring an authorized party is the source of commands; andrejecting unauthorized command and control attempts;establishment of methods to detect, report, and recover from anomalous network or system activity; anduse of secure software and hardware development practices, consistent with the NIST SSDF or any successor documents.Within 180 days of receiving the recommended contract language described in subsection (e)(i) of this section, the FAR Council shall review the proposal and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the agency members of the FAR Council shall jointly take steps to amend the FAR.Within 120 days of the date of this order, the National Cyber Director shall submit to OMB a study of space ground systems owned, managed, or operated by FCEB agencies. This study shall include:an inventory of space ground systems;whether each space ground system is classified as a major information system under 44 U.S.C. 3505(c), labeled \"Inventory of major information systems\"; andrecommendations to improve the cyber defenses and oversight of such space ground systems.Within 90 days of the submission of the study described in subsection (e)(iii) of this section, the Director of OMB shall take appropriate steps to help ensure that space ground systems owned, managed, or operated by FCEB agencies comply with relevant cybersecurity requirements issued by OMB.Sec. 4. Securing Federal Communications. (a) To improve the security of Federal Government communications against adversarial nations and criminals, the Federal Government must implement, to the extent practicable and consistent with mission needs, strong identity authentication and encryption using modern, standardized, and commercially available algorithms and protocols.The security of Internet traffic depends on data being correctly routed and delivered to the intended recipient network. Routing information originated and propagated across the Internet, utilizing the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), is vulnerable to attack and misconfiguration.Within 90 days of the date of this order, FCEB agencies shall take steps to ensure that all of their assigned Internet number resources (Internet Protocol (IP) address blocks and Autonomous System Numbers) are covered by a Registration Services Agreement with the American Registry for Internet Numbers or another appropriate regional Internet registry. Thereafter, FCEB agencies shall annually review and update in their regional Internet registry accounts organizational identifiers related to assigned number resources such as organization names, points of contact, and associated email addresses.Within 120 days of the date of this order, all FCEB agencies that hold IP address blocks shall create and publish Route Origin Authorizations in the public Resource Public Key Infrastructure repository hosted or delegated by the American Registry for Internet Numbers or the appropriate regional Internet registry for the IP address blocks they hold.Within 120 days of the date of this order, the National Cyber Director, in coordination with the heads of other agencies as appropriate, shall recommend contract language to the FAR Council to require contracted providers of Internet services to agencies to adopt and deploy Internet routing security technologies, including publishing Route Origin Authorizations and performing Route Origin Validation filtering. The recommended language shall include requirements or exceptions, as appropriate, for agency contracts regarding overseas operations and overseas local service providers. Within 270 days of receiving these recommendations, the FAR Council shall review the recommended contract language and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the agency members of the FAR Council shall jointly take steps to amend the FAR. Pending any such amendments to the FAR, individual agencies are encouraged to include such requirements in future contracts, consistent with applicable law.Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, shall publish updated guidance to agencies on deployment of current, operationally viable BGP security methods for Federal Government networks and service providers. The Secretary of Commerce, actingthrough the Director of NIST, shall also provide updated guidance on other emerging technologies to improve Internet routing security and resilience, such as route leak mitigation and source address validation.Encrypting Domain Name System (DNS) traffic in transit is a critical step to protecting both the confidentiality of the information being transmitted to, and the integrity of the communication with, the DNS resolver.Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall publish template contract language requiring that any product that acts as a DNS resolver (whether client or server) for the Federal Government support encrypted DNS and shall recommend that language to the FAR Council. Within 120 days of receiving the recommended language, the FAR Council shall review it, and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the agency members of the FAR Council shall jointly take steps to amend the FAR.Within 180 days of the date of this order, FCEB agencies shall enable encrypted DNS protocols wherever their existing clients and servers support those protocols. FCEB agencies shall also enable such protocols within 180 days of any additional clients and servers supporting such protocols.The Federal Government must encrypt email messages in transport and, where practical, use end-to-end encryption in order to protect messages from compromise.Within 120 days of the date of this order, each FCEB agency shall technically enforce encrypted and authenticated transport for all connections between the agency's email clients and their associated email servers.Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Director of OMB shall establish a requirement for expanded use of authenticated transport-layer encryption between email servers used by FCEB agencies to send and receive email.Within 90 days of the establishment of the requirement described in subsection (d)(ii) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall take appropriate steps to assist agencies in meeting that requirement, including by issuing implementing directives, as well as technical guidance to address any identified capability gaps.Modern communications such as voice and video conferencing and instant messaging are usually encrypted at the link level but often are not encrypted end-to-end. Within 180 days of the date of this order, to advance the security of Internet-based voice and video conferencing and instant messaging, the Director of OMB, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA; the Secretary of Defense, acting through the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA); the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST; the Archivist of the United States, acting through the Chief Records Officer for the United States Government; and the Administrator of General Services shall take appropriate steps to require agencies to:enable transport encryption by default; andwhere technically supported, use end-to-end encryption by default while maintaining logging and archival capabilities that allow agencies to fulfill records management and accountability requirements.Alongside their benefits, quantum computers pose significant risk to the national security, including the economic security, of the United States. Most notably, a quantum computer of sufficient size and sophistication\u2014also known as a cryptanalytically relevant quantum computer(CRQC)\u2014will be capable of breaking much of the public-key cryptography used on digital systems across the United States and around the world. In National Security Memorandum 10 of May 4, 2022 (Promoting United States Leadership in Quantum Computing While Mitigating Risks to Vulnerable Cryptographic Systems), I directed the Federal Government to prepare for a transition to cryptographic algorithms that would not be vulnerable to a CRQC.Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall release and thereafter regularly update a list of product categories in which products that support post-quantum cryptography (PQC) are widely available.Within 90 days of a product category being placed on the list described in subsection (f)(i) of this section, agencies shall take steps to include in any solicitations for products in that category a requirement that products support PQC.Agencies shall implement PQC key establishment or hybrid key establishment including a PQC algorithm as soon as practicable upon support being provided by network security products and services already deployed in their network architectures.Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST and the Under Secretary for International Trade, shall identify and engage foreign governments and industry groups in key countries to encourage their transition to PQC algorithms standardized by NIST.Within 180 days of the date of this order, to prepare for transition to PQC, the Secretary of Defense with respect to National Security Systems (NSS), and the Director of OMB with respect to non-NSS, shall each issue requirements for agencies to support, as soon as practicable, but not later than January 2, 2030, Transport Layer Security protocol version 1.3 or a successor version.The Federal Government should take advantage of commercial security technologies and architectures, such as hardware security modules, trusted execution environments, and other isolation technologies, to protect and audit access to cryptographic keys with extended lifecycles.Within 270 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, and the Administrator of General Services shall develop guidelines for the secure management of access tokens and cryptographic keys used by cloud service providers.Within 60 days of the publication of the guidelines described in subsection (g)(i) of this section, the Administrator of General Services, acting through the FedRAMP Director, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall develop updated FedRAMP requirements, incorporating the guidelines described in subsection (g)(i) of this section, as appropriate and consistent with guidance issued by the Director of OMB, concerning cryptographic key management security practices.Within 60 days of the publication of the guidelines described in subsection (g)(i) of this section, the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST; the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA; and the Administrator of General Services shall take appropriate steps to require FCEB agencies to follow best practices concerning the protection and management of hardware security modules, trusted executionenvironments, or other isolation technologies for access tokens and cryptographic keys used by cloud service providers in the provision of services to agencies.Sec. 5. Solutions to Combat Cybercrime and Fraud. (a) The use of stolen and synthetic identities by criminal syndicates to systemically defraud public benefits programs costs taxpayers and wastes Federal Government funds. To help address these crimes it is the policy of the executive branch to strongly encourage the acceptance of digital identity documents to access public benefits programs that require identity verification, so long as"

Biden, Jr., 2025Proclamation 10883\u2014Religious Freedom Day, 2025January 15, 2025By the President of the United States of America A ProclamationFaith sustains many of us across our Nation, sharpening our sense of purpose, uniting us in shared belief, and reminding us of our obligations to each other. Whether you worship in a church, synagogue, temple, or mosque, the Constitution of the United States protects every American's right to practice their faith freely or to practice no faith at all. Today, we celebrate our constitutional right to religious freedom which makes us a beacon of liberty and recommit to protecting that right, both here at home and around the world.We are all blessed to live in a Nation that is home to people of many faiths. However, even in our land of liberty, too many people are afraid that practicing their faith will bring fear, violence, and intimidation. Over the past year, we have seen a shocking rise in antisemitism in the wake of Hamas's terrorist attack against Israel and a disturbing rise in Islamophobia. Hate has no safe harbor here in America. And around the world, minority communities continue to live in fear of violence and are denied equal protections under the law, including Christians in some countries.My Administration is committed to ensuring that people of every faith and belief can live out their deepest conviction freely, peacefully, and safely. Working with the Congress, my Administration secured the largest ever increase in funding for the physical security of non-profit organizations, including places of worship. Through that program and many related efforts, we continue to work across government to ensure that all religious communities are able to practice their faith without fear. Additionally, I created the inter-agency group to counter Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination within the United States. We released the first-ever United States National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, which works to counter antisemitism and protect Jewish communities. We also released the first-ever National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia and Anti-Arab Hate, which works to combat these forms of hate and safeguard Muslim and Arab Americans. Both strategies seek to strengthen coalitions across religious communities to bring an end to hate.We are also working to promote and protect religious freedom worldwide, because it is not only an American constitutional right\u2014it is a human right, enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And so, around the globe, we are working with governments and organizations to end discrimination against religious groups. My Administration has provided $100 million to promote religious freedom worldwide. We have also provided hundreds of millions more to support victims fleeing religious repression. And we have been cracking down on forced labor, which is often connected to the targeting of religious minorities. My Administration sanctioned more than 240 individuals and entities for serious human rights abuses under the Global Magnitsky Sanctions Program. The Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism at the Department of State promoted the United States\u2013led \"Global Guidelines for Countering Antisemitism,\" a set of international best practices for effective public policy against antisemitism, which more than 40 countries and entities have endorsed. My Administration also ended the discriminatory travel ban that prevented individuals from several Muslim-majority and African countries from entering the United States. And the Department of State conducted a review of visa applications and took various corrective actions to process applications that were impacted by that ban, including reconsidering previously denied applications.Today, we recognize how religious freedom is at the core of who we are as a Nation. It is central to the freedom we offer all Americans. And it is threaded throughout all our work to advance human freedom and dignity in the world. The task for all of us is to defend and protect religious liberty for everyone, to build a world where no one is endangered for what they believe, and to see one another as neighbors.Now, Therefore, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2025, as Religious Freedom Day.In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.Joseph R.

        "Content":"\nDCPD202500070Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Letter to the Nation on the Biden-Harris Administration RecordJanuary 15, 2025Four years ago, we stood in a winter of peril and a winter of possibilities. We were in the grip of the worst pandemic in a century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. But we came together as Americans, and we braved through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous, and more secure.Today, we have the strongest economy in the world and have created a record 16.6 million new jobs. Wages are up. Inflation continues to come down. The racial wealth gap is the lowest it's been in 20 years. We're rebuilding our entire nation\u2014urban, suburban, rural, and Tribal communities. Manufacturing is coming back to America. We're leading the world again in science and innovation, including the semiconductor industry. And we finally beat Big Pharma to lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors. More people have health insurance today in America than ever before. I signed one of the most significant laws helping millions of veterans who were exposed to toxic materials and their families, as well as the most significant climate law ever and the first major gun safety law in nearly 30 years. Today, the violent crime rate is at a 50-year low.I ran for president because I believed that the soul of America was at stake. The very nature of who we are was at stake. And, that's still the case. America is an idea stronger than any army and larger than any ocean. It's the most powerful idea in the history of the world. That idea is that we are all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We've never fully lived up to this sacred idea, but we've never walked away from it either. And I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.Vice President Harris and I asked our staff to prepare a detailed summary of the progress we've made together throughout the last four years. Below, I'm sharing our record with you. I hope you'll do your part to build on the progress we've made.It has been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years. Nowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as President of the United States. I have given my heart and my soul to our nation. And I have been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people.History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. We just have to keep the faith and remember who we are. We are the United States of America, and there is simply nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.Thank you.Joseph R.

That's why we worked with congressional Democrats to include the Butch Lewis Act in my American Rescue Plan.With today's actions, our administration has provided security to over 1.3 million workers and retirees and will ultimately restore or protect the earned retirement benefits of roughly 2 million Americans so that they receive the full retirement benefits that they have earned over the next several decades.Categories: Statements by the President : UNITE HERE workers and retirees, pension benefits protection efforts .Names: Harris, Kamala D.Subjects: Economic stimulus legislation; Pensions and retirement accounts, strengthening efforts; UNITE HERE; Vice President.DCPD Number: DCPD202500069.\n"

        "Content":"\nDCPD202500081Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Executive Order 14143\u2014Providing for the Appointment of Alumni of AmeriCorps to the Competitive ServiceJanuary 16, 2025By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:Section 1. Policy. The Federal Government benefits from a workforce that can be recruited from the broadest and deepest pools of qualified candidates for merit-based positions. The issuance of an order granting Non-Competitive Eligibility to certain alumni of programs administered by the Corporation for National and Community Service (operating as AmeriCorps) would be in the best interest of the Federal Government. AmeriCorps alumni have demonstrated a sustained commitment to public service, have received extensive training and hands-on experience, and have developed leadership, communication, and technical skills that are aligned with the missions of many federal agencies and departments. It is in the interest of the Federal Government to retain the services of these highly skilled individuals, particularly given that the Federal Government aided them in the acquisition of their skills.Accordingly, pursuant to my authority under 5 U.S.C. 3302(1), and in order to achieve a workforce that is drawn from all segments of society as provided in 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1), I find that conditions of good administration make necessary an exception to the competitive hiring rules for certain positions in the Federal civil service.Sec. 2. Establishment. The head of any executive department or agency may appoint noncompetitively any individual who is certified under section 3 of this order to a position in the competitive service for which the individual is qualified.Sec. 3. Certifications. (a) The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of AmeriCorps, or the CEO's designee, shall issue certificates to persons whom the CEO or designee deems to have satisfactorily completed:a full-time term of national service of at least 1,700 hours as a Team Leader or Member, as specified in section 155(b)(1) or 155(b)(4) of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12615(b)(1), 12615(b)(4)), or in the AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps program component specified in section 153 of that Act (42 U.S.C. 12613); orone or more terms of service that total at least 1,700 hours under section 139(b)(1) of that Act (42 U.S.C. 12593(b)(1)) as an AmeriCorps State and National participant under section 137 of that Act (42 U.S.C. 12591).This order does not alter or otherwise affect the Non-Competitive Eligibility status for AmeriCorps Volunteers in Service to America participants, commonly known as VISTA members, who successfully complete their service, as described in section 415(d) of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5055(d)).In making any certification under this section, the CEO, or the CEO's designee, may rely on a confirmation made by the entity that selected the individual for, and supervised the individual in, the approved national service position in which such individual successfully completed a term of service, as specified in this section. If AmeriCorps determines that thecertification is incorrect, the Corporation shall, after considering the full facts and circumstances surrounding the incorrect certification, take appropriate action.Any appointment under this order shall be effected within 1 year after completion of the appointee's most recent term of service in the programs described in subsections (a)(i)\u2013(ii) of this section. Such period may be extended to not more than 3 years for persons who, following participation in the programs described in subsections (a)(i)\u2013(ii) of this section, are engaged in an additional term of AmeriCorps service, in military service, in the pursuit of studies at an institution of higher learning, or in other activities that, in the view of the appointing authority, warrant an extension of such period. Such period may also be extended to permit the adjudication of a background investigation.Any law, Executive Order, or regulation that would disqualify an applicant for appointment in the competitive service shall also disqualify an applicant for appointment under this order. Examples of disqualifying criteria include restrictions on employing persons who are not United States citizens or nationals; who have violated 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(7) and 3310 (the anti- nepotism provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978); who have knowingly and willfully failed to register for Selective Service when required to do so, 5 U.S.C. 3328(a)(2); who do not meet occupational qualifying standards prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); or who do not meet suitability factors prescribed by OPM.Sec. 4. Regulations. The Director of OPM is authorized to issue such additional regulations as may be necessary to implement this order. Any individual who meets the terms of this order, however, is eligible for noncompetitive hiring with or without additional regulations.Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; orthe functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.Joseph R.

        "Content":"\nDCPD202500094Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Remarks at Royal Missionary Baptist Church in North Charleston, South CarolinaJanuary 19, 2025The President. Hello, hello, hello. Please. Please, sit.Before I begin, let me tell you what I told Jim about 20 minutes ago.I used to start off, as a young kid getting involved in the civil rights\u2014my State, Delaware, to its great shame was a\u2014anyway, fought on the wrong side of the\u2014[laughter]. My State was segregated by law. My State, Delaware, was no different in terms of its laws than South Carolina or any other Southern State. And like two other States, just couldn't figure out how to get in the fight on the side of the South because it was cut off. But the southern two parts of my State\u2014\u2014[At this point, the President briefly imitated a Southern accent.]\u2014\u2014they talk funny like y'all do down here. You know what I mean? [Laughter]And\u2014but all kidding aside, I used to\u2014I used to go, when I got engaged to\u2014in the\u2014II didn't plan on\u2014I love reading these biographies on how I knew I was going to be President, going to run for President, et cetera. Truth of the matter was that I'm a kid who\u2014we talk about impediments; I used to ta\u2014t\u2014ta\u2014talk\u2014talk like that. I used to stutter. Came from\u2014came from a\u2014you know, came from a place called Claymont, Delaware. A lot of steel town\u2014it all went bankrupt. Come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. Things didn't work out so well because of the economy.But you know what? Every time\u2014every time\u2014I spent time in the Black church\u2014I was telling Jim\u2014I think of one thing: the word \"hope.\" [Applause] No, not a joke.Pastor Holt, thank you for allowing me to be back at this pulpit. And, Senator, thank you for that introduction. I appreciate it.You know, you made a really moving sermon, Pastor. And thank you, for the congregation of Royal Missionary Baptist Church, for welcoming me back to Charleston to worship with you.I prayed with you here in February of 2020 when I was running for President. On my final full day as President, of all the places I wanted to be was back here with you.I first got involved in public life because of the civil rights movement. I'd attend 7:30 mass at my church, then I'd go to another morning service at the AME Church in Delaware: the Black church, the spiritual home of the Black experience that helped redeem the soul of the Nation, literally.That's the truth we honor on the weekend we celebrate one of the political heroes\u2014my political heroes, many of yours\u2014Dr. Martin Luther King. I have two busts in my office that I can see from my desk. I had two political heroes growing up: Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy. No, I'm serious. You've been in my office, Jim. There's two busts that I see from my desk.On Sundays, we often reflect on resurrection and redemption. We remember Jesus was buried on Friday and He rose on Sunday. We don't talk enough about Saturday, when His disciples felt all hope was lost.Our lives and in the lives of the Nation, we have those Saturdays; we bear\u2014to bear witness of the day before glory, and some people's pain\u2014are in pain and they can't look away. But what\u2014the work we do on Saturday is going to determine whether we move with pain or purpose.How can faith get a person, get a nation through what's to come? Here's what my faith has taught me. Scripture says, \"As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another person.\" That's what faith and friendship has taught me.And friends in South Carolina, like Jim and Emily Clyburn, I could not be standing here, I would not be standing\u2014that's not hyperbole\u2014I would not be staying here in this pulpit were it not for Jim Clyburn.And although somewhat presumptuous of me, neither of us would be standing here without Emily, who we all miss dearly, and who actually made Jim endorse me. [Laughter][The President looked up toward the ceiling.] Thank you, Emily. [Laughter]South Carolina friends like Fritz and Peatsy Hollings, who believed in me when I got through one of the most difficult times of my life. When I was a 26-year\u2014or -9-year-old kid, I got a phone call saying my wife and daughter were dead and my two boys were not likely to live.Well, guess what? Jim, Emily, Fritz and Peatsy, and so many friends in South Carolina have always been there for me, and especially in those Saturdays when I felt all hope was gone; those days when I buried pieces of my soul\u2014my wife, my daughter, my son Beau, who was the attorney general of Delaware; when I felt like there was just a black hole in my chest sucking me into it\u2014anger and rage that I felt at the time.But then, friends\u2014your friends bear witness. They see your pain. They pick you up to help you get to Saturday\u2014to Sunday, from pain to purpose.I felt that faith of\u2014friendship when I prayed with this congregation\u2014when they play\u2014 played with the congregation and prayed with the congregation of Mother Emanuel.I went there and tried to confront [comfort; White House correction] them on my own Saturday, but it was they who ended up comforting me, as we arrived together and found grace together. Moving from pain to purpose strengthened my faith in the service of others, to \"love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and soul and all thy mind\" and \"love thy neighbor as thyself.\"Very easy to say, but very hard to do. But in the words\u2014in those words are the essence of the Gospel, is the essence of the American promise: the idea, as was mentioned earlier, that we're all created equal in the image of God and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.My dad used to say, \"The greatest sin of all is the abuse of power.\"We've never fully lived up to that commitment, but we've never walked away from it either because of you and your ancestors before us, who followed light of the north star even in the darkness.After this service, I'll be visiting the International African American Museum. It captures the ongoing story of redemption. I'll tour the exhibits, and I'll speak about the power of history to make real the promise of America for all Americans. But this morning I'd like to talk about the essential piece of redemption: the power of mercy and justice.With experience, wisdom, conscience, compassion, and science, we know how healing and restoration from harm is the pathway to the kind of communities we want to live in, where there's fairness, justice, accountability in the system; where the people we love go through hard times, fall down, make mistakes, but we're right there to help them get back up.We don't turn on each other. We lean into each other. That's the sacred covenant of our Nation. We pledge an allegiance, not just to an idea, but to each other. That's who we're pledging allegiance to.That's how I viewed my decision to issue more individual pardons and commutations than any President in American history. To inspire an end to Federal death penalty by commuting most of those sentences to life in prison without parole. To commute the sentence of individuals serving disproportionately hard, long, and harsh sentences for nonviolent drug offenses compared to the sentence they would have received today in commuting [committing; White House correction] that crime. To show mercy for individuals who either did their time or a significant amount of time and have shown significant remorse and rehabilitation. To understand that supervision after release is critical to provide accountability and support, while knowing that Government supervision over a very long time serves neither the interest of the person or the public.These decisions are difficult. Some have never been done before. But, in my experience, with my conscience, I believe, taken together, justice and mercy requires as a nation to bear witness; to see people's pain, not to look away; and do the work to move pain to purpose, to show we can get a person, a nation, to a day of redemption.But we know the struggle toward redeeming the soul of this Nation is difficult and ongoing, the distance is short between peril and possibility, but faith\u2014faith\u2014teaches us the America of our dreams is always closer than we think. That's the faith we must hold on to for the Saturdays to come.We must hold on to hope. We must stay engaged. We must always keep the faith in a better day to come. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not kidding.So, to the people of South Carolina, thank you for keeping the faith. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your President, the highest honor for Jill and our family.Audience member. Yeah, Jill! [Laughter]The President. And as I close out this journey with you, I'm just as passionate about our work as I was as a 29-year-old kid when I got elected and wasn't old enough to serve yet. I'm in no ways tired.I've always heard before: \"We've come too far from where we started. Nobody told me the road would be easy.\" \"I don't believe\u2014[applause]. I don't believe He brought me this far to leave me.\" My fellow Americans, I don't think the good Lord brought us this far to leave us behind.As we celebrate Dr. King's legacy and generations before and since\u2014women and men, enslaved and free\u2014we have to remember one of his favorite hymns: \"Precious Lord, take my hand through the storm, through the night, and lead me into the light.\"Well, God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.I owe you big. As they say where I come from, you all\u2014you're the guys that brought me to the dance.Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.NOTE: The President spoke at 12:31 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to Rep. James E. Clyburn; and former South Carolina State Sen. Marlon E.

        "Content":"\nDCPD202500090Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Letter to the Nation on the Investing in America AgendaJanuary 17, 2025My Fellow Americans,Four years ago, the pandemic was raging and the economy was reeling. Vice President Harris and I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in our nation's history by making sure this would be a presidency for all Americans. We made a commitment to write a new economic playbook to grow the economy from the middle-out and bottom-up instead of the top down. Critically important, we made sure the historic laws we signed would make once-in-a-generation investments in all of America. We call it our Investing in America agenda.Four years later, we are proud to issue this report that captures the Investing in America agenda comprised of some of the most significant investments ever made that will transform our nation for the better for decades to come.This long-term agenda builds on the foundation laid by the American Rescue Plan, which I signed into law as soon as I came into office to vaccinate the nation and deliver immediate economic relief to Americans who needed it the most. It kept people in their homes, businesses and schools open, and helped cut child poverty in half. It stemmed the tide of the pandemic and economic crises, allowing the economy to land softly without a recession.Our Investing in America agenda followed with ground-breaking laws that have been long talked about, but that we finally got done. Our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is already modernizing our roads, bridges, and airports, expanding access to clean water and high-speed Internet, and so much more from 72,000 projects so far with more to come. Our CHIPS and Science Act is making sure our supply chains start in America instead of end in America\u2014by bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to America and attracting billions of dollars in private sector investment. Our Inflation Reduction Act includes the most significant investments in climate and clean energy ever, while also reducing health care and prescription drug costs for millions of seniors.In total, our Investing in America agenda is creating millions of good-paying jobs\u2014many of them union jobs and jobs that don't require a college degree. These are jobs in new factories with good wages to raise a family on. These are jobs in hometowns so young people don't have to move in search for work. These are investments that are improving the quality of life for all of our communities\u2014cities, suburbs, small towns, rural communities, and across Tribal nations.These benefits are only the beginning. Today, the first American-made leading-edge chips are being mass produced. By the end of 2026, we are on track to repair over 356,300 miles of highway and over 20,800 bridges. By the end of 2028, we will replace over one million toxic lead pipes, bringing clean drinking water to over 2.5 million people. And by the end of 2030, every household and small business in America will be connected to affordable, reliable, high-speed Internet.Four years later, we are now better positioned than any nation in the world to win the economic competition of the 21st century. We did it by proving we are the United States of America and there is nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.Joseph R. Biden, Jr.NOTE: The letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary as part of a report titled, \"Investing in America Report: Today's Investments, Tomorrow's Future.\"Categories: Letters and Messages : \"Investing in America\" agenda, letter.

        "Content":"\nDCPD202500089Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Joint Statement by President Biden and Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada on Participation of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy in the 2028 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles, CaliforniaJanuary 17, 2025The United States and Canada call on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, a confederacy of Indigenous Nations in North America, to compete in lacrosse at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games as their own team under their own flag.The IOC has officially announced that the sport of lacrosse will be included in medal competition at the 2028 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The Haudenosaunee invented the sport of lacrosse nearly a thousand years ago. They consider the sport a treasured part of their cultural heritage, and this sport has since enriched the world.While participation in the Olympics is generally reserved for recognized countries, the Haudenosaunee are seeking a special exception from the IOC to field their own lacrosse team. Given the unique and exceptional circumstances of the Haudenosaunee's historic connection to this sport, and their Men's and Women's teams continuously ranked participation in international competitive lacrosse for almost half a century, we believe that a narrowly scoped exception is appropriate.While we respect the IOC's independence, we encourage the IOC to take advantage of this historic opportunity. Permitting the Haudenosaunee to compete in lacrosse\u2014the sport they invented\u2014would advance the highest values of the Olympic Games and send a powerful message about respecting and valuing indigenous cultural heritage.NOTE: An original was not available for verification of the content of this joint statement.Categories: Joint Statements : Canada, Prime Minister Trudeau, Haudenosaunee Confederacy participation in 2028 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles, CA.Names: Trudeau, Justin P.J.Subjects: California, 2028 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles; Canada, Prime Minister; Haudenosaunee Confederacy, participation in 2028 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles, CA; International Olympic Committee; Lacrosse; Olympic Games.DCPD Number: DCPD202500089.\n"

        "Content":"\nDCPD202500076Administration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2025Memorandum on Extending and Expanding Eligibility for Deferred Enforced Departure for Certain Hong Kong ResidentsJanuary 15, 2025Memorandum for the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland SecuritySubject: Extending and Expanding Eligibility for Deferred Enforced Departure for Certain Hong Kong ResidentsThe United States supports the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the residents of Hong Kong. The People's Republic of China (PRC) has continued to significantly erode those rights and freedoms. I am therefore directing an extension and expansion of the deferral of removal of certain Hong Kong residents, regardless of country of birth, who are present in the United States.By unilaterally imposing on Hong Kong the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (NSL) in June 2020, the PRC has undermined the enjoyment of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong, including those protected under the Basic Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Following the NSL's enactment, the PRC has continued its assault on Hong Kong's autonomy, undermining its remaining democratic processes and institutions, imposing limits on academic freedom, and cracking down on freedom of the press. Since June 2020, at least 200 opposition politicians, activists, and protesters have been taken into custody on politically motivated NSL-related charges including secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or external elements. On November 19, 2024, Hong Kong authorities also sentenced 45 pro- democracy advocates to prison for their peaceful participation in political activities protected under the Basic Law of Hong Kong.There are compelling foreign policy reasons to extend Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for an additional period for those residents of Hong Kong presently residing in the United States who were under a grant of DED until February 5, 2025, as well as to defer enforced departure for other Hong Kong residents who arrived in the United States subsequent to the initial grant of DED. The United States is committed to a foreign policy that unites our democratic values with our foreign policy goals, which is centered on the defense of democracy and the promotion of human rights around the world. Offering safe haven for Hong Kong residents who have been deprived of their guaranteed freedoms in Hong Kong furthers United States interests in the region. The United States will continue to stand firm in our support of the people in Hong Kong.Pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States, I have determined that it is in the foreign policy interest of the United States to defer for 24 months the removal of any Hong Kong resident, regardless of country of birth, who is present in the United States on the date of this memorandum, except for those:who have voluntarily returned to Hong Kong or the PRC after the date of this memorandum;who have not continuously resided in the United States since the date of this memorandum;who are inadmissible under section 212(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)) or deportable under section 237(a)(4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(4));who have been convicted of any felony or two or more misdemeanors committed in the United States, or who meet any of the criteria set forth in section 208(b)(2)(A) of the INA (8U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A));who are subject to extradition;whose presence in the United States the Secretary of Homeland Security has determined is not in the interest of the United States or presents a danger to public safety; orwhose presence in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.I further direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take appropriate measures to authorize employment for noncitizens whose removal has been deferred, as provided by this memorandum, for the duration of such deferral, including by extending through February 5, 2027, employment authorization for individuals with current employment authorization under prior grants of DED for certain Hong Kong residents, and to consider suspending regulatory requirements with respect to F\u20131 nonimmigrant students who are Hong Kong residents as the Secretary of Homeland Security determines to be appropriate. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall also provide for the prompt issuance of new or replacement documents in appropriate cases.The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.Joseph R. Biden, Jr.[Filed with the Office of the Federal Register, 2 p.m., January 16, 2025]NOTE: This memorandum was published in the Federal Register on January 17.Categories: Communications to Federal Agencies : Hong Kong residents in U.S., deferred enforced departure, memorandum .Subjects: Hong Kong refugees in the U.S., status ; Hong Kong, political status with respect to mainland China; Refugees and migrants, U.S. admission policy; Secretary of Homeland Security; Secretary of State.DCPD Number: DCPD202500076.\n"

Biden, Jr., 2025Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Widespread Humanitarian Crisis in Afghanistan and the Potential for a Deepening Economic Collapse In AfghanistanJanuary 15, 2025To the Congress of the United States:Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to the widespread humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the potential for a deepening economic collapse in Afghanistan declared in Executive Order 14064 of February 11, 2022, is to continue in effect beyond February 11, 2025.The widespread humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan\u2014including the urgent needs of the people of Afghanistan for food security, livelihoods support, water, sanitation, health, hygiene, and shelter and settlement assistance, among other basic human needs\u2014and the potential for a deepening economic collapse in Afghanistan continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. In addition, the preservation of certain property of Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) held in the United States by United States financial institutions is of the utmost importance to addressing this national emergency and the welfare of the people of Afghanistan. Various parties, including representatives of victims of terrorism, have asserted legal claims against certain property of DAB or indicated in public court filings an intent to make such claims. This property is blocked under Executive Order 14064.Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14064 with respect to the widespread humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the potential for a deepening economic collapse in Afghanistan.Joseph R.

        "Content":"\nDCPD202500126Administration of Donald J. Trump, 2025Executive Order 14159\u2014Protecting the American People Against InvasionJanuary 20, 2025By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:Section 1. Purpose. Over the last 4 years, the prior administration invited, administered, and oversaw an unprecedented flood of illegal immigration into the United States. Millions of illegal aliens crossed our borders or were permitted to fly directly into the United States on commercial flights and allowed to settle in American communities, in violation of longstanding Federal laws.Many of these aliens unlawfully within the United States present significant threats to national security and public safety, committing vile and heinous acts against innocent Americans. Others are engaged in hostile activities, including espionage, economic espionage, and preparations for terror-related activities. Many have abused the generosity of the American people, and their presence in the United States has cost taxpayers billions of dollars at the Federal, State, and local levels.Enforcing our Nation's immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the United States. The American people deserve a Federal Government that puts their interests first and a Government that understands its sacred obligation to prioritize the safety, security, and financial and economic well-being of Americans.This order ensures that the Federal Government protects the American people by faithfully executing the immigration laws of the United States.Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to faithfully execute the immigration laws against all inadmissible and removable aliens, particularly those aliens who threaten the safety or security of the American people. Further, it is the policy of the United States to achieve the total and efficient enforcement of those laws, including through lawful incentives and detention capabilities.Sec. 3. Faithful Execution of the Immigration Laws. In furtherance of the policies described in section 2 of this order:Executive Order 13993 of January 20, 2021 (Revision of Civil Immigration Enforcement Policies and Priorities), Executive Order 14010 of February 2, 2021 (Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework To Address the Causes of Migration, To Manage Migration Throughout North and Central America, and To Provide Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border), Executive Order 14011 of February 2, 2021 (Establishment of Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families), and Executive Order 14012 of February 2, 2021 (Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans) are hereby revoked; andExecutive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all appropriate action to promptly revoke all memoranda, guidance, or other policies based on the Executive Orders revoked in section 3(a) of this order and shall employ all lawful means to ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States against all inadmissible and removable aliens.Sec. 4. Civil Enforcement Priorities. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to enable the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, theCommissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to set priorities for their agencies that protect the public safety and national security interests of the American people, including by ensuring the successful enforcement of final orders of removal. Further, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that the primary mission of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations division is the enforcement of the provisions of the INA and other Federal laws related to the illegal entry and unlawful presence of aliens in the United States and the enforcement of the purposes of this order.Sec. 5. Criminal Enforcement Priorities. The Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall take all appropriate action to prioritize the prosecution of criminal offenses related to the unauthorized entry or continued unauthorized presence of aliens in the United States.Sec. 6. Federal Homeland Security Task Forces. (a) The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to jointly establish Homeland Security Task Forces (HSTFs) in all States nationwide.The composition of each HSTF shall be subject to the direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, but shall include representation from any other Federal agencies with law enforcement officers, or agencies with the ability to provide logistics, intelligence, and operational support to the HSTFs, and shall also include representation from relevant State and local law enforcement agencies. The heads of all Federal agencies shall take all appropriate action to provide support to the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that the HSTFs fulfill the objectives in subsection (c) of this section, and any other lawful purpose that fulfills the policy objectives of this order.The objective of each HSTF is to end the presence of criminal cartels, foreign gangs, and transnational criminal organizations throughout the United States, dismantle cross-border human smuggling and trafficking networks, end the scourge of human smuggling and trafficking, with a particular focus on such offenses involving children, and ensure the use of all available law enforcement tools to faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States.The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to provide an operational command center to coordinate the activities of the HSTFs and provide such support as they may require, and shall also take all appropriate action to provide supervisory direction to their activities as may be required.Sec. 7. Identification of Unregistered Illegal Aliens. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action to:Immediately announce and publicize information about the legal obligation of all previously unregistered aliens in the United States to comply with the requirements of part VII of subchapter II of chapter 12 of title 8, United States Code;Ensure that all previously unregistered aliens in the United States comply with the requirements of part VII of subchapter II of chapter 12 of title 8, United States Code; andEnsure that failure to comply with the legal obligations of part VII of subchapter II of chapter 12 of title 8, United States Code, is treated as a civil and criminal enforcement priority.Sec. 8. Civil Fines and Penalties. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of Treasury, shall take all appropriate action to ensure the assessment and collection of all fines and penalties that the Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized by law to assess and collect from aliens unlawfully present in the United States, including aliens whounlawfully entered or unlawfully attempted to enter the United States, and from those who facilitate such aliens' presence in the United States.(b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a report to the President regarding their progress implementing the requirements of this section and recommending any additional actions that may need to be taken to achieve its objectives.Sec. 9.

The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action, pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA (8U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I)), to apply, in her sole and unreviewable discretion, the provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the INA to the aliens designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II). Further, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly take appropriate action to use all other provisions of the immigration laws or any other Federal law, including, but not limited to sections 238 and 240(d) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1228 and 1229a(d)), to ensure the efficient and expedited removal of aliens from the United States.Sec. 10. Detention Facilities. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources or establish contracts to construct, operate, control, or use facilities to detain removable aliens. The Secretary of Homeland Security, further, shall take all appropriate actions to ensure the detention of aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law pending the outcome of their removal proceedings or their removal from the country, to the extent permitted by law.Sec. 11. Federal-State Agreements. To ensure State and local law enforcement agencies across the United States can assist with the protection of the American people, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, and with the consent of State or local officials as appropriate, take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)) or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary of Homeland Security determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties. To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary of Homeland Security may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)) in the manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws in that jurisdiction.Sec. 12.

Recalcitrant Countries. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to:Cooperate and effectively implement, as appropriate, the sanctions provided by section 243(d) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1253(d)), with the Secretary of State, to the maximum extent permitted by law, ensuring that diplomatic efforts and negotiations with foreign states include the foreign states' acceptance of their nationals who are subject to removal from the United States; andEliminate all documentary barriers, dilatory tactics, or other restrictions that prevent the prompt repatriation of aliens to any foreign state.

Sanctuary Jurisdictions. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, to the maximum extent possible under law, evaluate and undertake any lawful actions to ensure that so-called \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions, which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to Federal funds. Further, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall evaluate and undertake any other lawful actions, criminal or civil, that they deem warranted based on any such jurisdiction's practices that interfere with the enforcement of Federal law.Sec. 18. Information Sharing. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly issue guidance to ensure maximum compliance by Department of Homeland Security personnel with the provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1373 and 8 U.S.C. 1644 and ensure that State and local governments are provided with the information necessary to fulfill law enforcement, citizenship, or immigration status verification requirements authorized by law; and(b) The Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to stop the trafficking and smuggling of alien children into the United States, including through the sharing of any information necessary to assist in the achievement of that objective.Sec. 19.

        "Content":"\nDCPD202500123Administration of Donald J. Trump, 2025Executive Order 14156\u2014Declaring a National Energy EmergencyJanuary 20, 2025By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (\"NEA\"), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:Section 1. Purpose. The energy and critical minerals (\"energy\") identification, leasing, development, production, transportation, refining, and generation capacity of the United States are all far too inadequate to meet our Nation's needs. We need a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation's manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness. Caused by the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration, our Nation's inadequate energy supply and infrastructure causes and makes worse the high energy prices that devastate Americans, particularly those living on low- and fixed-incomes.This active threat to the American people from high energy prices is exacerbated by our Nation's diminished capacity to insulate itself from hostile foreign actors. Energy security is an increasingly crucial theater of global competition. In an effort to harm the American people, hostile state and non-state foreign actors have targeted our domestic energy infrastructure, weaponized our reliance on foreign energy, and abused their ability to cause dramatic swings within international commodity markets. An affordable and reliable domestic supply of energy is a fundamental requirement for the national and economic security of any nation.The integrity and expansion of our Nation's energy infrastructure\u2014from coast to coast\u2014is an immediate and pressing priority for the protection of the United States' national and economic security. It is imperative that the Federal government puts the physical and economic wellbeing of the American people first.Moreover, the United States has the potential to use its unrealized energy resources domestically, and to sell to international allies and partners a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy. This would create jobs and economic prosperity for Americans forgotten in the present economy, improve the United States' trade balance, help our country compete with hostile foreign powers, strengthen relations with allies and partners, and support international peace and security. Accordingly, our Nation's dangerous energy situation inflicts unnecessary and perilous constraints on our foreign policy.The policies of the previous administration have driven our Nation into a national emergency, where a precariously inadequate and intermittent energy supply, and an increasingly unreliable grid, require swift and decisive action. Without immediate remedy, this situation will dramatically deteriorate in the near future due to a high demand for energy and natural resources to power the next generation of technology. The United States' ability to remain at the forefront of technological innovation depends on a reliable supply of energy and the integrity of our Nation's electrical grid. Our Nation's current inadequate development of domestic energy resources leaves us vulnerable to hostile foreign actors and poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States' prosperity and national security.These numerous problems are most pronounced in our Nation's Northeast and West Coast, where dangerous State and local policies jeopardize our Nation's core national defense and security needs, and devastate the prosperity of not only local residents but the entire United States population. The United States' insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, andgeneration constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation's economy, national security, and foreign policy. In light of these findings, I hereby declare a national emergency.Sec. 2. Emergency Approvals. (a) The heads of executive departments and agencies (\"agencies\") shall identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them, as well as all other lawful authorities they may possess, to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources, including, but not limited to, on Federal lands. If an agency assesses that use of either Federal eminent domain authorities or authorities afforded under the Defense Production Act (Public Law 81\u2013774, 50 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) are necessary to achieve this objective, the agency shall submit recommendations for a course of action to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.(b) Consistent with 42 U.S.C. 7545(c)(4)(C)(ii)(III), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, after consultation with, and concurrence by, the Secretary of Energy, shall consider issuing emergency fuel waivers to allow the year-round sale of E15 gasoline to meet any projected temporary shortfalls in the supply of gasoline across the Nation.Sec. 3. Expediting the Delivery of Energy Infrastructure. (a) To facilitate the Nation's energy supply, agencies shall identify and use all relevant lawful emergency and other authorities available to them to expedite the completion of all authorized and appropriated infrastructure, energy, environmental, and natural resources projects that are within the identified authority of each of the Secretaries to perform or to advance.To protect the collective national and economic security of the United States, agencies shall identify and use all lawful emergency or other authorities available to them to facilitate the supply, refining, and transportation of energy in and through the West Coast of the United States, Northeast of the United States, and Alaska.The Secretaries shall provide such reports regarding activities under this section as may be requested by the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.Sec. 4. Emergency Regulations and Nationwide Permits Under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Other Statutes Administered by the Army Corps of Engineers. (a) Within 30 days from the date of this order, the heads of all agencies, as well as the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works shall:identify planned or potential actions to facilitate the Nation's energy supply that may be subject to emergency treatment pursuant to the regulations and nationwide permits promulgated by the Corps, or jointly by the Corps and EPA, pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344, section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899, 33 U.S.C. 403, and section 103 of the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1413 (collectively, the \"emergency Army Corps permitting provisions\"); andshall provide a summary report, listing such actions, to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (\"OMB\"); the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works; the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy; and the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). Such report may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.Agencies are directed to use, to the fullest extent possible and consistent with applicable law, the emergency Army Corps permitting provisions to facilitate the Nation's energy supply.Within 30 days following the submission of the initial summary report described in subsection (a)(ii) of this section, each department and agency shall provide a status report to the OMB Director; the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works; the Director of the National Economic Council; and the Chairman of the CEQ. Each such report shall list actions taken within subsection (a)(i) of this section, shall list the status of any previously reported planned or potential actions, and shall list any new planned or potential actions that fall within subsection (a)(i). Such status reports shall thereafter be provided to these officials at least every 30 days for the duration of the national emergency and may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, shall be available to consult promptly with agencies and to take other prompt and appropriate action concerning the application of the emergency Army Corps permitting provisions. The Administrator of the EPA shall provide prompt cooperation to the Secretary of the Army and to agencies in connection with the discharge of the responsibilities described in this section.Sec. 5.

        "Content":"\nDCPD202500118Administration of Donald J. Trump, 2025Executive Order 14151\u2014Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and PreferencingJanuary 20, 2025By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:Section 1. Purpose and Policy. The Biden Administration forced illegal and immoral discrimination programs, going by the name \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI), into virtually all aspects of the Federal Government, in areas ranging from airline safety to the military. This was a concerted effort stemming from President Biden's first day in office, when he issued Executive Order 13985, \"Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.\"Pursuant to Executive Order 13985 and follow-on orders, nearly every Federal agency and entity submitted \"Equity Action Plans\" to detail the ways that they have furthered DEIs infiltration of the Federal Government. The public release of these plans demonstrated immense public waste and shameful discrimination. That ends today. Americans deserve a government committed to serving every person with equal dignity and respect, and to expending precious taxpayer resources only on making America great.Sec. 2. Implementation. (a) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), assisted by the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), shall coordinate the termination of all discriminatory programs, including illegal DEI and \"diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility\" (DEIA) mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities in the Federal Government, under whatever name they appear. To carry out this directive, the Director of OPM, with the assistance of the Attorney General as requested, shall review and revise, as appropriate, all existing Federal employment practices, union contracts, and training policies or programs to comply with this order. Federal employment practices, including Federal employee performance reviews, shall reward individual initiative, skills, performance, and hard work and shall not under any circumstances consider DEI or DEIA factors, goals, policies, mandates, or requirements.Each agency, department, or commission head, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Director of OMB, and the Director of OPM, as appropriate, shall take the following actions within sixty days of this order:terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all DEI, DEIA, and \"environmental justice\" offices and positions (including but not limited to \"Chief Diversity Officer\" positions); all \"equity action plans,\" \"equity\" actions, initiatives, or programs, \"equity-related\" grants or contracts; and all DEI or DEIA performance requirements for employees, contractors, or grantees.provide the Director of the OMB with a list of all:agency or department DEI, DEIA, or \"environmental justice\" positions, committees, programs, services, activities, budgets, and expenditures in existence on November 4, 2024, and an assessment of whether these positions, committees, programs, services, activities, budgets, and expenditures have been misleadingly relabeled in an attempt to preserve their pre\u2013November 4, 2024 function;Federal contractors who have provided DEI training or DEI training materials to agency or department employees; andFederal grantees who received Federal funding to provide or advance DEI, DEIA, or \"environmental justice\" programs, services, or activities since January 20, 2021.direct the deputy agency or department head to:assess the operational impact (e.g., the number of new DEI hires) and cost of the prior administration's DEI, DEIA, and \"environmental justice\" programs and policies; andrecommend actions, such as Congressional notifications under 28 U.S.C. 530D, to align agency or department programs, activities, policies, regulations, guidance, employment practices, enforcement activities, contracts (including set- asides), grants, consent orders, and litigating positions with the policy of equal dignity and respect identified in section 1 of this order. The agency or department head and the Director of OMB shall jointly ensure that the deputy agency or department head has the authority and resources needed to carry out this directive.To inform and advise the President, so that he may formulate appropriate and effective civil-rights policies for the Executive Branch, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall convene a monthly meeting attended by the Director of OMB, the Director of OPM, and each deputy agency or department head to:hear reports on the prevalence and the economic and social costs of DEI, DEIA, and \"environmental justice\" in agency or department programs, activities, policies, regulations, guidance, employment practices, enforcement activities, contracts (including set-asides), grants, consent orders, and litigating positions;discuss any barriers to measures to comply with this order; andmonitor and track agency and department progress and identify potential areas for additional Presidential or legislative action to advance the policy of equal dignity and respect.Sec. 3. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected.Sec. 4.

Trump, 2025Executive Order 14149\u2014Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal CensorshipJanuary 20, 2025By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:Section 1. Purpose. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution, an amendment essential to the success of our Republic, enshrines the right of the American people to speak freely in the public square without Government interference. Over the last 4 years, the previous administration trampled free speech rights by censoring Americans' speech on online platforms, often by exerting substantial coercive pressure on third parties, such as social media companies, to moderate, deplatform, or otherwise suppress speech that the Federal Government did not approve. Under the guise of combatting \"misinformation,\" \"disinformation,\" and \"malinformation,\" the Federal Government infringed on the constitutionally protected speech rights of American citizens across the United States in a manner that advanced the Government's preferred narrative about significant matters of public debate. Government censorship of speech is intolerable in a free society.Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to:secure the right of the American people to engage in constitutionally protected speech;ensure that no Federal Government officer, employee, or agent engages in or facilitates any conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen;ensure that no taxpayer resources are used to engage in or facilitate any conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen; andidentify and take appropriate action to correct past misconduct by the Federal Government related to censorship of protected speech.Sec. 3. Ending Censorship of Protected Speech. (a) No Federal department, agency, entity, officer, employee, or agent may act or use any Federal resources in a manner contrary to section 2 of this order.The Attorney General, in consultation with the heads of executive departments and agencies, shall investigate the activities of the Federal Government over the last 4 years that are inconsistent with the purposes and policies of this order and prepare a report to be submitted to the President, through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, with recommendations for appropriate remedial actions to be taken based on the findings of the report.Sec. 4. General Provisions.

Trump, 2025Executive Order 14147\u2014Ending the Weaponization of the Federal GovernmentJanuary 20, 2025By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:Section 1. Purpose. The American people have witnessed the previous administration engage in a systematic campaign against its perceived political opponents, weaponizing the legal force of numerous Federal law enforcement agencies and the Intelligence Community against those perceived political opponents in the form of investigations, prosecutions, civil enforcement actions, and other related actions. These actions appear oriented more toward inflicting political pain than toward pursuing actual justice or legitimate governmental objectives. Many of these activities appear to be inconsistent with the Constitution and\/or the laws of the United States, including those activities directed at parents protesting at school board meetings, Americans who spoke out against the previous administration's actions, and other Americans who were simply exercising constitutionally protected rights.The prior administration and allies throughout the country engaged in an unprecedented, third-world weaponization of prosecutorial power to upend the democratic process. It targeted individuals who voiced opposition to the prior administration's policies with numerous Federal investigations and politically motivated funding revocations, which cost Americans access to needed services. The Department of Justice even jailed an individual for posting a political meme. And while the Department of Justice has ruthlessly prosecuted more than 1,500 individuals associated with January 6, and simultaneously dropped nearly all cases against BLM rioters.Therefore, this order sets forth a process to ensure accountability for the previous administration's weaponization of the Federal Government against the American people.Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to identify and take appropriate action to correct past misconduct by the Federal Government related to the weaponization of law enforcement and the weaponization of the Intelligence Community.Sec. 3. Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government. (a) The Attorney General, in consultation with the heads of all departments and agencies of the United States, shall take appropriate action to review the activities of all departments and agencies exercising civil or criminal enforcement authority of the United States, including, but not limited to, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission, over the last 4 years and identify any instances where a department's or agency's conduct appears to have been contrary to the purposes and policies of this order, and prepare a report to be submitted to the President, through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and the Counsel to the President, with recommendations for appropriate remedial actions to be taken to fulfill the purposes and policies of this order.The Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the heads of the appropriate departments and agencies within the Intelligence Community, shall take all appropriate action to review the activities of the Intelligence Community over the last 4 years and identify any instances where the Intelligence Community's conduct appears to have been contrary to the purposes and policies of this order, and prepare a report to be submitted to the President, through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and the National Security Advisor, with recommendations for appropriate remedial actions to be taken to fulfill the purposes and policies of this order. Theterm \"Intelligence Community\" has the meaning given the term in section 3003 of title 50, United States Code.In furtherance of these policies, departments and agencies are directed to comply with applicable document-retention policies and legal obligations. Instances of noncompliance with document-retention policies or legal obligations will be referred to the Attorney General.Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; orthe functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.Donald J.

Trump, 2025Proclamation 10886\u2014Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border of the United StatesJanuary 20, 2025By the President of the United States of America A ProclamationBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby proclaim:America's sovereignty is under attack. Our southern border is overrun by cartels, criminal gangs, known terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males from foreign adversaries, and illicit narcotics that harm Americans, including America.This invasion has caused widespread chaos and suffering in our country over the last 4 years. It has led to the horrific and inexcusable murders of many innocent American citizens, including women and children, at the hands of illegal aliens. Foreign criminal gangs and cartels have begun seizing control of parts of cities, attacking our most vulnerable citizens, and terrorizing Americans beyond the control of local law enforcement. Cartels control vast territories just south of our southern border, effectively controlling who can and cannot travel to the United States from Mexico. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have tragically died from drug overdoses because of the illicit narcotics that have flowed across the southern border.This assault on the American people and the integrity of America's sovereign borders represents a grave threat to our Nation.Because of the gravity and emergency of this present danger and imminent threat, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to take all appropriate action to assist the Department of Homeland Security in obtaining full operational control of the southern border.To protect the security and safety of United States citizens, to protect each of the States against invasion, and to uphold my duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, it is my responsibility as President to ensure that the illegal entry of aliens into the United States via the southern border be immediately and entirely stopped.As Commander in Chief, I have no more solemn duty than to protect the American people.Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), hereby declare that a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United States, and that section 12302 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretaries of the military departments concerned, subject to the direction of the Secretary of Defense. To provide additional authority to the Department of Defense to support the Federal Government's response to the emergency at the southern border, I hereby declare that this emergency requires use of the Armed Forces and, in accordance with section 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), that the construction authority provided in section 2808 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretary of Defense and, at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, to the Secretaries of the military departments. I hereby direct as follows:Section 1. Deployment of Personnel and Resources. The Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of each relevant military department, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall order as many units or members of the Armed Forces, including the Ready Reserve and the National Guard, as the Secretary of Defense determines to be appropriate to support the activities of the Secretary of Homeland Security in obtaining complete operational control of the southern border of the United States. The Secretary of Defense shall further take all appropriate action to facilitate the operational needs of the Secretary of Homeland Security along the southern border, including through the provision of appropriate detention space, transportation (including aircraft), and other logistics services in support of civilian-controlled law enforcement operations.Sec. 2.

To the extent possible, the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security shall coordinate with any Governor of a State that is willing to assist with the deployment of any physical infrastructure to improve operational security at the southern border.Sec. 3. Unmanned Aerial Systems. The Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Communications Commission shall, consistent with applicable law, consider waiving all applicable Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Communications Commission regulations or policies, respectively, that restrict the Department of Homeland Security's ability to counter unmanned aerial systems within 5 miles of the southern border.Sec. 4. Revision of Policies and Strategies. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action, consistent with law, to prioritize the impedance and denial of the unauthorized physical entry of aliens across the southern border of the United States, and to ensure that use of force policies prioritize the safety and security of Department of Homeland Security personnel and of members of the Armed Forces.Sec. 5. Revocation. Proclamation 10142 of January 20, 2021 (Termination of Emergency With Respect to the Southern Border of the United States and Redirection of Funds Diverted to Border Wall Construction), is hereby revoked.Sec. 6. Reporting Requirement. (a) Within 30 days of the date of this proclamation, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the President, through the Homeland Security Advisor, a report outlining all actions taken to fulfill the requirements and objectives of this proclamation; andWithin 90 days of the date of this proclamation, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a joint report to the President about the conditions at the southern border of the United States and any recommendations regarding additional actions that may be necessary to obtain complete operational control of the southern border, including whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807.Sec. 7.
